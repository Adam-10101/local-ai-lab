### 1. Core Copilot Concepts
#### Identify Copilot accounts and subscriptions
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Narrator] Microsoft has several products that use the Copilot name. There are several different features and ways to use Copilot, and not all users are able to access all of those features, so this is the key. Which Copilot features and products you're able to use depends on whether you use Copilot with a certain account or paid subscription. One of the main ways to work with Copilot is on the Copilot website, copilot.microsoft.com. At the top, there's an Account button. You can click that to find the option to sign in. Users who do not sign in get the smallest set of features, but they can still ask questions, make requests, or have ongoing chat conversations with the Copilot AI using this chat field. I'll be showing you that as we go through this course. But if you do sign in to an account, there are different types of accounts. To start, you can sign in with a free Microsoft online account. If you don't have a free account, there's an option to make one. And signing in with a free account enables a few extra features, or you can pay for a subscription to enable even more features. An individual can pay for the Copilot Pro subscription. This enables faster responses with newer language models. But the big thing with Copilot Pro is that you can use the Copilot assistant integrated inside of Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. So as an individual, you can sign in with a free Microsoft account, or you can pay for a Copilot Pro subscription. But what about people who use Microsoft products in a business or similar organization? If you have a Microsoft 365 account that was assigned to you by your employer, school, or a government agency, then you can sign into Copilot with that account. Now you absolutely can go to copilot.microsoft.com, then click the Sign in button there. However, if you're working with a company, school, or government account like this, Microsoft recommends you use a different website because you'll get more controls there. So you can go to microsoft365.com/chat. After signing in, this allows you to use the core Copilot chat tool with faster responses and enterprise level data protection to protect your privacy when using Copilot for work-related tasks. Or just like we saw for individuals, there is still a higher level subscription you can purchase or your organization can purchase the upgraded license for you. This upgraded license is called Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription allows users to work with Copilot inside of the Office applications, including Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint and Teams. But it also allows people in the organization to use the chat assistant to ask questions about their coworkers, calendar events, documents, and other private information in their organization. This is known as Business Chat. So these are the options for users in a business, enterprise, school or government organization. Those users can work with a core Copilot chat assistant with enterprise data protection, or they can upgrade to Microsoft 365 Copilot to use the Business Chat and use Copilot inside of the Office applications. This is just a brief overview, but you can see why it's important to know which accounts or subscriptions you have or may want to have before you start working with Copilot. And as we go through the rest of this workshop, we'll start with the free Copilot features that are available to all users, then explore some of the other features included in these higher level accounts and subscriptions.
#### Use Copilot on the web, in Windows, or the mobile app
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] Let's take a quick look at some of the main places people go to use Copilot. There are different features and different ways to work with copilot, but we will start at copilot.microsoft.com. This website is the best starting point for many users, especially first time users. It's important to know that this website will probably change and evolve quickly as is the nature of AI technology and websites, but here's what you can expect for consistency. At the top, usually near the top left or top right corner, you should see an account button or a sign in button. When you click that, you can adjust some settings, but most importantly, you can sign into your Microsoft account or double check to see which account you're signed into, next, in the middle of the page, or it could be at the bottom of the page for you, you see a chat field. You can use this to type questions, requests, or just have a conversation with Copilot. In the future, this chat field may look different or it may have a slightly different layout, but the core functionality will be the same. I'll use the chat field to ask a question. I'll ask, what are typical interest rates for residential mortgages in Northern California over the past year? In fact, right now I have a dropdown. I can open the chat menu and change to a quick response or a think deeper response, which is better for complex topics and will give me a much more in-depth answer from Copilot. But for now, I'll click the submit message button Copilot's giving me an answer, but here's something you should look out for. Copilot does use information from the internet, so it's possible that it may find inaccurate information. So in these responses, see these citations, these small numbers are clickable links that will take you to the websites where Copilot found this information. And sometimes, there's even more links below the response. So for important mission critical information, you can click those links and fact check the information yourself. Next, Copilot can support ongoing chat questions, so I could ask a follow-up question. In fact, Copilot will usually give me some good follow up questions that I can click on directly to keep going with this conversation. Instead, I'll ask, do things change significantly in other states? I did not have to remind it that we were talking about residential mortgage rates. Copilot remembers the context of this conversation, and it can give me an answer. You can scroll back to see the questions and answers from this conversation, and if you ever want to start over with a new conversation with no previous context, you can start a new chat. On the top left hand side, look for the new chat button. You can click that to reset, and now it does not remember the details of that previous conversation. So as we go through this workshop and sign into different types of accounts and use different versions of Copilot, things may look different, but I expect that you'll always be able to find the account sign in button, the chat field, the citations and the answers, and the new chat button. There's one more thing I wanted to point out, and that is the microphone button next to the chat field. This allows you to talk to Copilot directly and have a conversation like you would with a real person. This is an exciting feature, but it's not there in all versions of Copilot. Sometimes you may see the mic and it will allow you to dictate your prompt. I'll be talking about that and the differences in the two icons in a later video. For now, I do want to let you know that the website is not the only place to work with Copilot. If you are using Windows 11, you probably see the Copilot button in the task bar. If not, you can go to the start menu and you can either search for Copilot or it may be in your pinned list. When you open it, you might see an interface like this, or Microsoft may update this in the future, but this time the account button is on the bottom left hand side of the screen. But here's the chat window. Up here on the top left is the new conversation window. You can work with Copilot here if you prefer. Let's see one more way to work with Copilot. There's a free Copilot app for iPhones, iPads, and Android devices. I have it installed on my iPad, so I'll launch that icon. I can tap the three horizontal lines on the top left hand side of the screen and then tap my icon to go into my account or sign in or sign out. Then at the bottom, there's that same chat field where you can ask a question. And finally, on the top right hand side of the screen, I can tap to start a brand new conversation. Again, I have those same quick response icons, and there's that microphone in which I can talk to Copilot. I have been asking some pretty basic questions here. You can also ask Copilot to draft text, create pictures, but more importantly, you can ask much more complex questions. I recommend you take a look at the Copilot prompt gallery, which can be found at copilot.cloud.microsoft.com/en-us/prompts. You can filter by what type of task you're looking to do, job type, and it gives you a list of prompts to get you started. At the top, you can explore prompts in each of the products, and you can even see a list of prompts to try. This can help you with more complex and nuanced tasks, but there are also other courses on LinkedIn learning about Copilot tools. But I also recommend you look up courses about prompt engineering, which is a technique for having complex, meaningful interactions with AI assistance, like Copilot.
#### Understand other Copilot products
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] In this workshop, I'm focusing on the different Copilot subscriptions, working with the Copilot Chat Assistant and Copilot tools inside of Office applications. But I want to briefly recognize that there is a larger collection of products with the Copilot branding, and many of these tools require the purchase of additional separate licenses. I'm on the page for Microsoft Copilot. If you wanted to join me, you can use these menus at the top and in the For organizations category, there's several other Copilot products. Copilot Studio is a tool that you can use to build your own chat assistants, also known as agents. So, you can make an agent that's able to answer questions about topics and information that you define. Then, you can share that agent with your coworkers or clients, and we do have a short training course on Copilot Studio, available on LinkedIn Learning. Then, there's Copilot tools designed for specific jobs, like Copilot for Sales. This is a set of AI tools and a CRM platform to help sales teams manage customer relationships and streamline sales processes. There's also Copilot for Service. This brings AI tools to customer service call centers to help support agents work more efficiently. And these are just a few of the additional tools that are available or coming soon. But, since Microsoft uses the name Copilot as a general brand name for their AI tools, you should expect more and more tools with that name to appear over time, and we do have separate courses on LinkedIn Learning from many of these other Copilot products.
### 2. Use Copilot as an individual
#### Use Copilot with a free account
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] If you are an individual user, not affiliated with a business or similar organization, you might sign into Copilot with a free Microsoft account. Let's talk about some of the features you get with this free account. Starting at the website, copilot.microsoft.com, you should click the account button at the top. You can sign into an account, or if you already are signed in, you can confirm which account you're using. You can see I am signed in, and if you do sign in, even with a free account like this, it enables some very valuable features. For example, the ability to talk for a longer amount of time using the natural voice chat tool. As of this recording, you'll get about two minutes of talk time when you're not signed in. It's also important to note this feature is not even available in the enterprise and business versions of Copilot. This is only available for the free and Copilot pro versions. So I'm going to click this microphone and I want you to see that I can talk to Copilot like a real person. And you'll see that I can interrupt it when I want it to stop and move in another direction. If this is the first time you're using this tool, you may have to click to allow your browser to use the microphone. (gentle music) - [Assistant] Hi again, Jess. - [Instructor] I don't understand why somebody would want to get a CD rather than a normal savings account. - [Assistant] I get what you mean. But CDs usually offer higher interest rates compared to normal savings accounts. The catch? You got to lock your money up for a set time. - [Instructor] Okay, but how long do I have to lock it in for? - [Assistant] Usually ranges from a few months to several years. The longer the term, the higher the interest. - [Instructor] Okay, that's too much detail. Just give me the quick version. What makes a CD better? - [Assistant] Simply put, CDs offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts. It's a trade-off for locking your money in for a set period. Good for earning more, if you don't need immediate access. (gentle music) - [Instructor] I'll close out of this. So that's how you can talk to Copilot like a person. But Copilot is not a person, so you don't have to worry about being rude to it. In fact, I encourage you to tell it to stop or interrupt it. Another big benefit to signing into an account to use Copilot is the history feature. You can click to open up this side panel and view your chat history. If you don't sign into an account, this history will always be empty. But if you are signed in, it's able to remember previous conversations. Now each item on this list is not a separate question. Each of these is a conversation, so I can click one to see all of the questions and answers I had in this chat session. In fact, I can even come back and ask another question here and continue with that context. Or I can always click this new chat button to reset. One more valuable feature is this plus button. This will let you upload a picture, then ask Copilot a question about the picture. So I'll click that. Choose Upload. And navigate to the folder on my computer where I have that picture. Now I can ask questions about this picture. I'll ask, "What is this building and when was it built?" It answers those questions based on that picture. And if I wanted more information, I could ask follow-up questions. So these are the additional features you get if you just sign into Copilot with a free account. Now we did this on the Copilot website, but these features also work in the Copilot app in Windows and the Copilot mobile app for smartphones and tablets.
#### Leverage Copilot Pro inside of Office apps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] We talked about how you can use Copilot with a free account, but beyond that, you can unlock even more features by paying for the Copilot Pro subscription. You can subscribe to Copilot Pro for $20 a month in the US. Copilot Pro uses newer language models, so users can expect faster answers. But the biggest feature is the ability to use Copilot inside of the desktop apps, like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. Of course, you can still go to copilot.microsoft.com and sign in with a Copilot Pro account. When you click the account icon, it will designate that you have the Pro subscription and this lets you use all of the same features that we saw with a free account, the chat assistant, the natural voice chat, and history. But to use Copilot inside of the Office applications, there's two ways you could do that. First, you could go to office.com and sign in with that same account. From here, look for these buttons on the left, which will open the web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook. I'll open up Word. This is a version of Microsoft Word that works in the web browser. You can create a new document, which will be saved to OneDrive, Microsoft's online storage tool, or you can open files from your OneDrive. I'll open up something from my recent list of documents. And here I have Copilot tools inside of Word. The first thing it's always going to do if I open up a document that has content in it is generate a summary of the document that I can read right at the top of the file. I can also select some text. And from here, I can click the Copilot button that appears next to that text. Clicking this offers to rewrite the text, or I could make it shorter or more formal, I can turn it into a table, or I can write a prompt asking for something specific. I'll ask it to make the selected text longer. (keyboard clicks) It's going to then show me an option for a longer version of that selected text. I don't want to keep this revision so I'll click the trashcan icon. Something else you have is the Copilot button on the top right-hand side of the ribbon at the top of the screen. This opens up the Copilot assistant. I can use this to get help with drafts or ask other questions all within the Microsoft Word interface. These tools will work differently in an Excel spreadsheet compared to a Word document or a PowerPoint presentation. They all have different ways of working inside each individual app. Now, these web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook are available to anybody with a Microsoft Online account, but the Copilot Pro subscription adds these unique Copilot features to these web apps, including this Copilot button to open up the pane. However, if you also have an individual subscription to Microsoft 365, then you will also have the full desktop applications. Microsoft 365 is a separate subscription, but since I do have it, I can launch Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook right on my computer. After launching Word, I'll create a new blank document. I have the Copilot tools right here in the body of the document. I can describe what I'd like to write and it gives me some ideas. I also have the Copilot button at the top of the ribbon to open up the Copilot assistant here inside of Word. So clearly you get the most if you have both a Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot Pro subscription. But for people who only have the Copilot Pro subscription, there is that option that we saw to use the web-based versions of these applications and get those Copilot features. So now you should have a clear picture of the features you'll get in Copilot if you sign in as an individual with a free account or if you upgrade to that Copilot Pro subscription.
### 3. Use Microsfot 365 Copilot
Use Microsoft 365 Copilot with commercial data protection
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Laura] If you work for a business, enterprise organization, a school, or government agency, you may have a Microsoft 365 subscription that was purchased by you or your employer. If you have an account like that, then you can use that to sign into Copilot. This is sometimes referred to as Copilot with Entra ID, because Entra ID is the login system that Microsoft uses for these accounts. Using Copilot like this enables enterprise level security for your Copilot interactions. Microsoft has a separate website to use Copilot with a company, school, or government account. If you go to copilot.microsoft.com and sign in with a work or school account, it will just give you a link to switch to that other site. So instead, it's better if you just go there straight to Microsoft365.com/chat. Then sign in to your work or school account here. You'll see that the Copilot interface looks a little different here. We do have the account button. This time it's at the bottom left hand side of the screen. Up here on the top right, there's a button to start a new chat, and there's still that message Copilot chat field here in the middle where you can ask questions or make requests. But in a work or school account, this microphone button here is used to dictate your request to Copilot, not to have an actual conversation like we saw in an earlier video. And when you use Copilot from the Microsoft 365 website like this, you get this navigation panel on the left. You can see that Copilot Chat is currently selected, but we can choose other options, and you may see different options here in the future. You can also click apps here at the bottom to navigate to other online web apps in your Microsoft 365 account. But aside from the Microsoft 365 interface, what do you get in Copilot when you sign in with a commercial account? Well, first, you're able to use Copilot for free like this. Now, obviously your organization is paying for the Microsoft 365 subscription, but there's no additional cost for Copilot. Also, with this type of account, you get enterprise data protection. Look for this Shield icon near the top right. This shield is not there for people who use Copilot with an individual account, that is the free or Copilot Pro account. This tells me that enterprise data protection is in place, and you can click on this link to find out more details about it. It's an enhanced level of security, which protects your Copilot interactions, so you can feel free to use Copilot for tasks related to your job knowing that they are protected by this enhanced security. Part of the security means that Copilot does not store your chat history in this configuration. So as you can see here, there's nowhere to go to see your previous conversations. You cannot browse your history. Also, for individual users outside of an organization, their questions and prompts, that is anything they type into this Message Copilot field, may be used to help Copilot learn and to improve the language models. But with this green shield, enterprise data protection, Copilot will not save and will not use your prompts this way. Everything is kept completely private within your account and your organization. So signing into Copilot with a Microsoft 365 account from your organization gives you the basic features of the Copilot chat with enhanced security protections at no additional cost.
#### Use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Office apps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] In another video, we saw that you can sign into Copilot with a Microsoft 365 account managed by your organization to enable enterprise data protection. But there is one more higher tier option for people in an organization. Your company, school, or government agency can purchase the Microsoft 365 Copilot license for you and your teammates. This subscription enables several additional Copilot tools and features. But the two big features that we will focus on for now are Business Chat and the ability to use Copilot inside of Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Teams. For a work or school account, you can go to Microsoft365.com/chat. I have an account assigned to me by my company, which has the Microsoft 365 Copilot license. So after I've signed in with that, we can work with Copilot here. There's two big differences. First, you do have the option to browse your chat history with Microsoft 365 Copilot. You can show or hide this panel. Next, at the top, there's a toggle switch where you can switch between work and web. If you choose web, this works very similar to what we've seen in this workshop. You can ask questions or make requests, and Copilot can answer using information it finds on the public internet. But if you switch to the work mode, then you can ask questions about your organization. You can ask about your own schedule, your own meetings, or you can ask about your coworkers. You can ask about documents that have been shared with you on OneDrive or SharePoint. This experience is known as Business Chat, and I'll give you an example. In this chat field, I will ask, which executives are mentioned in the, and then I need to refer to a specific document that's stored on my OneDrive. To refer to a specific person or document, you can type the forward slash key followed by the name of that person or document. And it searches through all of the documents that you have stored or have been shared with you on OneDrive or SharePoint. It found the document I want, so I'll select that and send the question. Copilot gives me an answer, which refers to a secure document that was shared with me by somebody in my organization. I can even ask follow-up questions. I'll ask, have I ever been in a meeting with any of them? So now I'm getting information about that shared document along with information about coworkers in my organization and my own email communication. But aside from the Business Chat experience, the Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscription also enables many Copilot features inside of office applications, including Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Word and Teams. Just like I showed you in the previous video, you can launch an Office application like Microsoft Word. You can click the account icon in the top right to see that you're signed into the same account. And when I create a new document, I have Copilot tools to help me in that document. Or, I can click the Copilot button in the ribbon to open the Copilot Assistant here in the application. I can ask Copilot to help me write or revise a draft here in Word, or I can ask other questions. But this goes beyond Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Microsoft Teams is used for communication, file sharing, and online meetings. If you go to the chat section in Microsoft Teams, you can click the Copilot Chat option here. And this lets you use the Business Chat experience right inside of Teams. So I can ask about my last meeting with a specific coworker, and it finds that information from my calendar. Or, if you go to a chat conversation with a real person, you can click the Copilot button in the top right-hand side. So you can ask Copilot for insights about an ongoing chat with a coworker. Also, if you have meetings in Teams, you can record those meetings, and Copilot can summarize or answer questions about any meeting as long as a transcript was recorded for five minutes or more. And if you have the subscription, I recommend you keep an eye out for that Copilot button, which will appear in different places in different Office applications. So the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription opens up a lot of additional features, not just for the Business Chat experience, but also helpful tools inside of several Office applications.

## Streamlining Your Work with Microsoft Copilot
### Introduction
#### Using Copilot as a productivity tool (48s video)
- Microsoft Copilot is an AI companion that can help you with research, analyze information, and generally make your workday easier. I'm Nick Brazzi, and in this short workshop, we're going to work with the personal version of Microsoft Copilot, with a focus on how it can help you in the workplace. You can use the chat tools in the free version of Copilot for questions, requests, or to just have ongoing conversations. You can upload files and ask for a detailed analysis. And if you use the Copilot Pro add-on, you can use AI tools inside of productivity applications like Microsoft Word and Excel. I want to help you craft the most effective questions, use Copilot to draft or create pictures, and even fact check the information that Copilot offers so you can be sure you're getting the best information.
#### Understand the different Copilot products (2m 26s video)
Understand the different Copilot products
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Microsoft offers different Copilot products, and I want to take a minute to clarify which of those products we will be focusing on in this workshop. To start, I'm just going to oversimplify and look at two different types of Copilot users. Some users will work with Copilot for personal use, meaning you're working alone and you sign in with your own account, but other people will work with Copilot with a Microsoft 365 subscription. Now, an individual can purchase their own personal Microsoft 365 subscription to use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more in their personal life or independent business. But many people use a Microsoft 365 subscription set up by their organization. That means that your company, your employer, your school, or government agency has a Microsoft 365 subscription and has assigned accounts to you and your coworkers. This is important because this workshop, the workshop that you're watching now, focuses only on the first category of users. How can you work with the Copilot tools that are designed for personal use, but use them for work and productivity? If you are using Copilot with a Microsoft 365 subscription, I encourage you to look at a separate course on LinkedIn Learning called Learning Microsoft 365 Copilot for Work. But for this workshop, if you are working as an individual, there are two main Copilot products to choose from. There is a free version known simply as Microsoft Copilot. You can go to the Copilot website and start using the AI chat for free. In fact, you don't even have to set up an account, but if you do set up a free account and sign in with that, Copilot can remember your conversation history and adds a few other features. Or, an individual user can pay a monthly fee for the Copilot Pro add-on license. In the Pro version, the Copilot Chat works mostly the same, but has preferred access to newer AI models and experimental features. And the main benefit of Copilot Pro is that it enables Copilot inside of Microsoft productivity applications like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Of course, we'll get a look at how these features work as we go through this workshop. These tools may be very useful for you in your personal life, but I will definitely focus on how you can use Copilot to streamline your work, even if you are using the personal version of Copilot.
### 1. Core Functions in Copilot Chat
#### Use Copilot on the web, in Windows, or in the mobile app (3m 56s video)
- You can work with the Copilot chat from the Copilot website in an app that comes with Windows or in the mobile app for smartphones and tablets. The website is the best starting point for many users, especially first time users. So we'll start at copilot.microsoft.com. Now, one of the most important things to remember about Copilot is that things change. The interface that you see here at the time of this recording might look a little different on your computer. I have seen the design and layout of this website change many times, but most things should work the same, even if there are small interface changes. At the top right corner, I see the sign-in button. When you click that, you can adjust some settings, but most importantly, you can sign into an account or if you are already signed in, you can see which account you're signed into. Now you do not have to sign into an account. You can just start working with Copilot directly, but there are some features that we will use in this workshop that will only be there if you sign into an account, features like the chat history and uploading files to Copilot. When you click the sign in button, you can use any Microsoft account you might already have like the Microsoft account you set up to sign into Windows or a free outlook.com account or an Xbox account. And if you don't already have an account, you can create one here. I'll sign into my account and now I see my account icon in the top right, and when I click that, I can see the account that I'm signed into, and this is a free account. I also see an option here to upgrade to Copilot Pro. When you click that, you can see the price and you can choose to purchase that add-on if you want. You do not need to pay for Copilot Pro to use this workshop, but there will be some features that do require Copilot Pro and I will point those out as we go. And if you do sign in with a Copilot Pro subscription, you'll see the Pro label in the account menu. So for most of this workshop, we will be working with Copilot here on this website, but there are a few different ways to work with Copilot. If you use the Microsoft Edge web browser, you will see a Copilot button on the top right. This helps if you navigate to some other webpage and you want to use Copilot while you're working on that other page. You can click the Copilot button in the Edge web browser to use the Copilot chat right here. The chat field, which is your main way of working with Copilot is right here in this panel. Next, if you are using Windows 11 and it has the current updates, you have a different option. You'll probably see the Copilot button in the task bar. If not, you can go to the start menu to the list of all applications and look for the Copilot application there. So that button on the task bar is just a shortcut to this application. But I will point out that you'll probably also see a separate app called Microsoft 365 Copilot, which you would use with a Microsoft 365 subscription in an organization like your company, school, or government agency. For now, we're seeing the features for a personal account so I'll launch the app that's simply called Copilot. And from here you can work with Copilot just like on the website. We see the same chat field. If you click the button near the top left, you can open or close the side panel. And in that side panel, you'll either see a button to sign into an account or an icon that shows which account you are signed into. And let's see one more way to work with Copilot. There is a free Copilot app for iPhone and Android devices, which I have installed on my phone. So I'll launch the Copilot app, and of course, we have the chat field. And using the button in the top left, you can open the panel to see the account button. You can tap the account button there to sign in or check which account you're signed into. So those are the different ways you can access Copilot chat, even if you don't sign into an account. And please be aware of changes. Things will be updated in the future, but the core features should always be fairly easy to find.
#### Ask simple or complex questions in on-going AI chats (4m 40s video)
- Let's start chatting with Copilot, and see how the AI can help with simple questions or much more complex requests. Remember, we're using the personal version of Copilot in this workshop, so we'll start at copilot.microsoft.com. Using the chat field, we can start with a basic question. So I'll ask, "What is the time difference between California and Italy?" And here's the answer. Copilot will support ongoing conversations and will remember the context. So I can ask a follow-up question. I'll ask, "Is the difference always the same?" Now, I did not have to restate that I'm interested in time zones between California and Italy. Copilot remembers the context and it answers that question, and it explains that the time difference does change in different parts of the year. And I can scroll up to see previous questions and answers in this chat. But at any time, you can clear that context and reset to a new topic by clicking the start new chat button near the top left. Now, if I ask something like, "What is the difference between the UK and Europe?" It is no longer answering that question in the context of time zones. This is a new topic, and it does not remember what we were talking about before. I'll click the new chat button again to reset. When I click the account icon in the top right, you can see that I am signed into an account. And if you are signed in, even with a free account, you can access your chat history. The button near the top left opens the side panel where you can see your history. And this is not a list of previous answers, it's a list of previous chat conversations. So you can select one and see all of the questions and answers from that ongoing chat. And you can even pick up and continue a conversation from here. Or if you need to remove a conversation from your history, just point your mouse at it in the history list and a menu button with three dots will appear. Click that, and you'll find the option to delete that conversation. Okay, I'll start a new chat conversation. And, again, I'll close the side panel. And next, I want to try some more complex questions. So I'll ask, "I'm thinking of converting my office to solar power. How big does a system need to be to power a commercial office building with 50 employees in Northern California?" Now, this is a topic that can quickly get technical with lots of details, but I can still treat it conversationally and just ask a question like this with plain language to get started. But before you send your question, there is a menu in the chat field where you can choose whether you want a quick response, which is what I use when I want to get a fast answer to most questions. Or you can ask Copilot to think deeper, which takes significantly more time, does more detailed research, and may present a more comprehensive response. I'll choose the think deeper option, then I'll click the send button. And I'll skip forward in time so we don't have to wait for Copilot's response. And this gives us a much more comprehensive response with lots of detailed and researched information. Another way to think of this is that you can use the quick response mode if you just need the answer, but the think deeper mode will show all of the details and how it found that answer. Of course, I can continue this conversation by asking, "How long would it take to install a system of this size?" And even in a follow-up question, you can decide whether you want it to think deeper or just give a quick response. I'll choose the quick response mode, and I get a brief response pretty quickly. Next, I'm going to switch to an account that has the Copilot Pro add-on subscription. You can see that this account has Copilot Pro, and I've already typed in that same question about solar power installation for my office, but I did not click the send button yet. In that menu with Copilot Pro, there is a third option called deep research. This will generate a complete research report, so let's see how that works. I'll choose that and click send, and it may ask some follow up questions to focus the research. I'll quickly answer those questions and then I'll click the send button. And now it starts by finding as many websites as it can with information relevant to that question. Then it will devise a detailed way to organize that information. And at this point, we do need to skip forward in time because this will take several minutes. And when it's finished, I can see that it has provided me with a very detailed research report. So we've seen a pretty wide range, from quick answers to basic questions all the way to a detailed research report. And you can always open your chat history and go back to these conversations at any time.
#### Use citations to fact-check information (1m 46s video)
- Copilot uses information from the internet to answer your questions and requests, so it is possible that it may find information that is inaccurate. If you use Copilot for important research or work-related projects, it may be very important to double-check Copilot's answers. Now, I could start by asking a question in Copilot, but I'll just click the button in the top left to open the side panel and I'll select one of my recent conversations from the history. This is a series of questions and answers we saw in another video, but you should look closely at Copilot's responses and look for these small numbers. These are citations. They are links that take you to the website where it found this information. You may not see citations on some responses, but I do see them here. You can click one of these citations to see a preview. Then you can click on that preview if you want to go to that website. Then you can check the information on that site and make sure it's reliable and accurate. And sometimes you will also see links to related information below a response. Now, this particular response is actually a research report generated by the Deep Research feature that we saw in another video. You will see citations in all types of Copilot responses, but I think citations are absolutely essential for these Deep Research reports. For a research report with this many citations, you will probably see the first few links listed, then a button to see the full list. So like any good research report, it cites the sources. If you are using Copilot in the workplace, it is absolutely essential to fact-check any mission-critical information. Don't just use information that Copilot offers, you have all of the tools you need to check that information and validate the accuracy before you act on it.
#### Share responses or save them in editable pages (4m 15s video)
- If you use Copilot without signing into an account, the responses you get from Copilot disappear as soon as you reset the chat conversation. But if you sign in with a free account or an account with a Copilot Pro subscription, Copilot will store your chat history, as we saw in another video. And signing in also lets you share your Copilot chats or store specific information from Copilot in editable pages. I'll open the side panel on the left where we see my chat history. You can point at a chat conversation and the menu button with three dots appears. And in this menu, you have the option to share a conversation. It shows a preview of that conversation where you can see every question and response. But I will point out, at least at the time of this recording, if a chat conversation contains a deep research report, that report will not be included in the share link, even if you do see it in this preview. So from here, you can click the button to copy the link, then paste that link in an email or text message or something like that, then send it to your coworkers. They can click that link to see the full Copilot chat. Next, it is nice that you can go back and review previous chat conversations, but you may want to add your own notes or combine information or edit information that Copilot found for you. You can start with a new chat, or you can go to your history and open a previous conversation. This is some useful information that I want to keep. Now, you will need to point your mouse cursor at a response, and then you'll see some options appear below that response, including the option to edit the response. And that will create what is known as a page. For the moment, this contains all of the information from that one Copilot response. It's not the full conversation, just the text of the one response that I chose, but you can edit information on a page. So I can just select some of this information and delete it, keeping only what I want. And I can type my own notes to add to it. You may want to click the title field at the top and give it a better name. And now when I open the side panel, you'll see that page is listed there in the section labeled Pages. You may need to click the refresh button in your web browser before the new name is updated there. So you can always go back to one of your pages by selecting it there. And there's a Delete button when you're viewing a page if you ever need to delete it. Next, if you want to just start taking notes directly, you can make a page manually. Next to the New Conversation button, in the top left, you can click the arrow to open the menu, and there's an option to create a new page there. I'll click the title field and rename it to International Launch Plans, and I can type in my notes. Now, you'll also notice that there is a Copilot chat available when you're viewing or editing a page. So if I needed to find some information for this page, I can ask Copilot. So I'll ask "Between South America and Europe, which would be easier to launch an e-commerce website?" Now notice we do not have the menu to choose between quick response or deep thinking. We just get a basic response here. But you can select any of the text in this response and copy it, or just click the Copy button at the bottom of the response. Then click on the page to place your cursor there and paste that text. And of course, you can make changes and add your own notes. Okay, I'll click the New Chat button at the top left to reset again. And when I open the panel on the side, I see my two pages are listed there. Now let's see one last option. I'll go to another conversation from my Copilot chat history, and I'll point at a response, and there is the option to edit this response. But now when I click on that, since I already have some pages saved, it asks if I want to add this information to an existing page or create a new page. Remember, you can select any of your pages from the side panel at any time to view them or edit them, or click the Delete button to delete them. So as long as you're signed into an account, even a free account, information that Copilot finds for you does not just go away. You've got options for sharing that information with your coworkers or creating pages to organize and add your own notes.
### 2. Explore Different Types of Copilot Prompts
#### Leverage prompt engineering for robust requests (4m 53s video)
Copilot As you learn how to work with Copilot, it can be challenging to even think of the questions you want to ask. Fortunately, there are some resources to help you learn the types of prompts Copilot best responds to. And you can start learning about prompt engineering, a technique for writing robust, detailed requests. First, when you start a new chat in Copilot, you will notice some suggested prompts. These show a few of the tasks that Copilot handles very well. You can click any of these starter prompts to try them, and it places the beginning of a prompt in the chat field. You may need to type in more text to finish the prompt, but for now, instead of this starter prompt, I'm just going to ask a pretty basic question. So I'll ask Copilot to give me a slogan for a solar power company. And here's the result, one slogan. This might be good enough, and of course I could continue with follow-up prompts and ask for revisions, but we can get a much more effective result using prompt engineering techniques. Part of prompt engineering includes writing longer, more detailed prompts, but you can do this most effectively by identifying different components of a good prompt to make sure you have all the information you need. Now, different sources will give you different components for a good prompt, and I don't think there's any one perfect formula, but here are some common components. You may want to start by defining the role. For this example, I'll tell Copilot, "You are an experienced marketing director specializing in growing businesses internationally." So as much as possible, it will answer my question the way that type of person would. Next, you should include detailed instructions for what you want in the response. I'll tell it that I'd like it to offer several ideas for a new marketing slogan for our solar power company. I'll tell it to give me five ideas organized in a table along with the reasoning for each slogan and the customer reactions each one is designed to elicit. So those are pretty detailed instructions. Next, I'll provide some context. Specifically, I wanted to offer options that are compliant with my company's mission statement. I actually have a document that contains my company's mission statement, and you can feel free to copy large pieces of text that you want Copilot to refer to and paste it into your prompt. For this example, I'm using something fairly short, our company's mission statement. So when I'm ready, I can just copy this and paste it into the prompt. So to provide context, I'm asking Copilot to only show slogan ideas that are consistent with that mission statement. Next, you may want to provide some constraints. I'll tell it to keep each slogan limited to five words or less, and to not use the word solar in the slogans. Now, some other components that you might consider including are your desired format. I kind of covered that when I asked Copilot to give me options in a table, but you can be more detailed with the format if you want. You may also want to specify tone and style. You may tell Copilot that you want it to use a casual style, or you might want a formal style. Telling it which style you want can significantly change the tone of the response. Okay, so you can use those techniques and write your prompt directly in the Copilot chat field, or, for long prompts like this, I prefer to write them out in a document first. I've written the prompt out here, and you can see I already pasted our mission statement here and wrote the rest of the prompt, and now I can copy and paste the full prompt into Copilot, and that way if I don't get the results that I want, I can come back here and adjust the prompt, then copy and paste it again. So I'll copy this. Then on the Copilot website, I will paste in this long prompt. With such a detailed prompt, it might be best to use the Think Deeper mode, but for now I'll stay with the quick response option so we don't have to wait, and that well-crafted prompt gives me a much better response. I see the five options along with the supporting information I requested in the format I wanted. This did take more work, but I got a much better result. Of course, you can ask follow-up questions to get more detail or change the parameters of your request. You may want to start by trying some of the components I mentioned in this video, but this does take practice and some more research may help you. There are several courses on LinkedIn Learning that focus on prompt engineering, and I also recommend the Copilot Prompt Gallery offered by Microsoft. This website contains many resources for using Copilot effectively, including information on how to write better prompts. As we go through the rest of this workshop, I will still use some fairly simple prompts just to show how the system works, but I encourage you to think about how prompt engineering can help you get more robust results from Copilot.
#### Talk to Copilot with natural voice interactions (4m 7s video)
- [Nick] You can talk to Copilot using your voice, letting you have natural conversations. It almost feels like talking to somebody in a phone call. When you're working with Copilot, you'll see a microphone button next to the chat field. In a moment, I'll click that, and talk to Copilot like a real person, and you'll see that I can interrupt it when I want it to stop and move in another direction. So let's give that a try. (alert beep) - [Copilot] Hey, Nick. - [Nick] I don't understand why somebody would want to get a CD rather than a normal savings account. - [Copilot] Well, getting a CD can mean higher interest rates if you commit your money for a fixed period. - [Nick] So what's the disadvantage? - [Copilot] The main downside is a lack of flexibility. With the CD, your money's locked in for a set term and withdrawing early usually means penalties. - Okay, just give me the quick version. What makes a CD better? - [Copilot] Higher interest rates, that's the main draw. You commit your money- - And when you want to get out of the voice chat, you can click the X. So this can be refreshing. Being able to stumble, rephrase, or rethink your questions as you go makes this feel so much more relaxed and natural. Of course, we talked about how valuable it can be to sit down and carefully craft a detailed prompt, but this is a different use case. This is for the times when you need a faster answer or you need to think as you go, or you just need to talk through your problem. This voice chat can be very helpful in lots of different scenarios. We just saw how to use it to research a topic. You can ask questions and discuss a nearly unlimited number of topics and Copilot can help you understand them. But here's another scenario. Copilot can help with things like practice interviews. So I'll reset to a new chat, and I'll click the microphone button again and ask it to help. (alert beeps) - [Copilot] Hey, Nick. - [Nick] I have a job interview for a role as a Level 2 IT desktop support technician. Can you ask me some practice questions? - [Copilot] Sure thing, Nick. Let's start with a classic one. How do you handle a situation where a user is unable to log into their computer? - [Nick] For now, I'll just click the X to stop that voice chat, but you can respond and continue as long as you want and have a full practice interview. Now, another option is to use Copilot when you're trying to learn a language. So, I'll reset again and I'll click the microphone button. (alert beeps) - [Copilot] Hey Nick, what's on your mind today? - I'm learning Italian. Can you help me practice? - [Copilot] Absolutely, I'd be happy to help. (narrator 1 speaking in foreign language) (narrator 2 speaking in foreign language) (narrator 1 speaking in foreign language) (narrator 2 speaking in foreign language) (narrator 1 speaking in foreign language) (alert beeps) - [Nick] So this can really help me practice by having conversations in Italian. Now, we saw this on a computer, but I find this particularly useful when I'm using the Copilot app on a smartphone. It almost feels like calling a friend to help you figure out a problem. Whether you use this on the Copilot website or on your mobile phone, you can go to the account menu, then to the Voice settings, and you can choose a different voice here. And if you're working in the mobile app, you'll also see the option to change the voice speed. So you might want to try different voices to see which you prefer. - [Copilot] As a companion, I learn about you and- - [Nick] And finally, it's important to recognize while the voice feature is great for conversational topics, at least at the time of this recording, there are some types of questions that the voice chat cannot respond to. So many of the techniques we'll see in this course will work with your voice, but you may have to go back to traditional text prompts for certain tasks. And if you do use the voice chat, I encourage you to tell it to stop or interrupt it. Copilot is not a person, so you don't have to worry about being rude to it. It's a tool that you can use however you want.
#### Summarize complex information (2m 7s video)
- Copilot is great at doing research and summarizing information. I'm going to give you some examples of how you can use this in your day-to-day work life. To start, let's imagine my manager has asked me to buy a new printer for the office, and they need it by the end of the day. I haven't bought a printer in years. I don't know the options, and I don't even know how much they cost. I'll have Copilot summarize some options for me. So in the chat field, I'll ask it to compare the top five small office printers with pros, cons, and price. And here's the response. It's done a lot of work for me. And remember, you can ask follow-up questions. I can ask it to format that in a table, or I can ask which of these are inkjet printers. And it answers that question based on information from the previous response. Next, let's look at this article that was published online. In this example, I have a meeting with a person who wrote this article. I don't have enough time to read the entire article, but I'd like to be able to talk to them about it. For this, I can use the Copilot panel built into Microsoft Edge. Of course, you only have this if you are using the Microsoft Edge web browser. And if you are, you can click the Copilot button in the top right. And from here, you can ask questions about the information on this page, or you can use this button to ask for a summary or type in the request into the chat field. I'll ask it to summarize this page and it gives me a summary. If I really don't have much time, I could follow up and ask it to make that summary shorter. Or let's try a specific question. I'll ask which resources or experts are cited in this article. And here is the information I asked for from the article. So if you use the Copilot panel in Microsoft Edge, you can ask questions or get summaries of the content that you're viewing in the web browser. And you can use this from almost any webpage, and that includes a Google document, if you use Google Docs on the web. Being able to quickly summarize information is going to save me a lot of time in my workday.
#### Write and edit text with Copilot (2m 22s video)
- Copilot can help you write or rewrite text by composing drafts for you. Now, as you use these features, I strongly recommend that you use the AI-generated text only as drafts to give you ideas or help you get started. You should always rewrite and revise for your specific needs. Now, I'm doing a guest speaking engagement for a company and they'd like me to give them a bio. I can use Copilot to compose one for me. I can simply go to the chat field and ask it to write a professional bio about me as a LinkedIn learning instructor and guest speaker. Include my passion for helping others learn new technology. Now, clearly there is information in this draft that is not completely accurate for me, but this is a good starting point. Remember, when you point at a response, some buttons appear below it. There's a button to copy the entire text of the response, so I could copy it there, then paste it somewhere else like a Microsoft Word document and make more changes. Or I could click the button to edit this response in a new page using the Pages feature here in Copilot as a place to refine the draft. Or of course, I can follow up and ask for changes. There are some suggested prompts I could use here, but I'll just type, make this shorter and more friendly. And you can do that all here on the Copilot website. But if you use the Microsoft Edge web browser, you can also use the Copilot panel built into Microsoft Edge. So first I'll navigate to some other webpage. This is the website for a tourism company. I'll open the page describing the tours that they offer. Then I'll click the Copilot button on the top right of the Edge web browser. And since I have a webpage open in the main part of the browser, I can ask Copilot for information about that page, or I can ask it to write a draft based on the content on the page. So I'll ask Copilot to create a social media post about the tours offered here. And it gives me a draft for a social media post. I can copy this and paste it anywhere I want. And if this is not quite right for my audience, I can ask for a revision or I'll ask it to write one that's suitable for LinkedIn. And this will probably be a better starting point for a LinkedIn post. So the next time you have writer's block, Copilot may be able to help you by writing first drafts of text for you.
#### Ask Copilot to create images (1m 25s video)
- Copilot can create AI generated images based on your instructions, and if you don't get what you want at first, you can ask it to make revisions. Now, there are some guidelines. You cannot create images of public figures. You also can't create images containing hateful content, or nudity, or violence. Basically, it won't create anything that violates the Copilot terms of service and community guidelines. So I need to make some pictures for a PowerPoint presentation. I'll ask Copilot to create an image of a laser printer with an hourglass above it. It takes some time, and it gives me a picture. But you can be more specific. You can ask it to create an illustration, or a drawing, or a photorealistic image. You can do that in the original request, or you can do that in a follow-up question. So I'll just continue this chat and ask it to try this in a steampunk style. Also, show this at a different angle and add an anthropomorphic mouse. Also, you should know that these generated images will have an invisible watermark on them. This uses a feature called content credentials. The invisible watermark labels them as AI generated images along with the time and date of creation. And here is the new option. From here, you can continue the conversation and ask for changes. And when you settle on a picture that you want to keep, there's a button to download a copy to your computer.
#### Upload files for Copilot to analyze (3m 50s video)
- One of the most useful things AI chat tools can do is analyze information that you provide. As we saw earlier in this workshop, you can use prompt engineering techniques to provide detailed information in your prompt. But it can be even more useful to upload documents, spreadsheets, or even pictures than ask Copilot to analyze specific information in those files. To start, you can click the plus button in the chat field. And this is another place where you can reset to a new conversation. But we also see the Upload option. This will let you upload a file, then ask Copilot a question about it. And the Upload option is only available if you are signed into an account. I'll choose Upload, and then I can choose a file from my computer. And you can upload documents, spreadsheets, PDF files, or even pictures. With the personal version of Copilot and Copilot Pro, you can only upload one file at a time. But there is a bit of a work around you can use to analyze information across multiple files. Let's start with an Excel sheet. This is the product inventory from a company that makes clean energy products. With the file uploaded, I'll ask, "How many individual solar panel products are listed in this sheet?" And it answers that question. Now, since Copilot supports ongoing conversations, I can ask a follow-up question. I'll ask it to "show a list of each solar panel unit, including how much power each can generate." And I can continue the conversation, focusing on information from the file I uploaded. But you can also upload an additional file in one of these follow-up questions. So I need to make sure to not reset the conversation. I do want to continue with the current context. I'll click the plus button and upload another file. And I have a marketing presentation from this company in a PowerPoint file. I'll upload that. And I'll ask, "Are any of the products from this presentation listed in that inventory?" And I'll send that question. So even though you can only upload one file at a time, you can still upload additional files with each follow-up question. And then you can compare information between them in an ongoing chat. Next, I'll upload a picture. I could start a new chat to reset, but let's continue with this ongoing conversation. I'll click the plus button, then choose Upload, and I have a picture of a device here. First I'll ask, "What is this device? Is anything like this listed in the inventory?" And Copilot successfully identified it as an electric vehicle charger. And it shows that it is not listed in the inventory spreadsheet that I uploaded a moment ago. But let's not give up yet. I'll try to write a prompt that clarifies my specific goals and we'll see if Copilot is able to make an analysis and offer some ideas based on the documents and the picture I provided. So I'll type, "Are there any products or workflows mentioned in the presentation that relate to this EV charger? Assume the role of an experienced marketing director. These EV chargers will be installed in my city. Give me suggestions for marketing strategies to promote Kineteco products that can be used with this charger." And you can see I'm using a little of the prompt engineering techniques we saw earlier in this workshop. And to get some really detailed insight, I'll set this to the Think Deeper mode and see what Copilot can come up with. I need to give it a little extra time, so I'll skip forward. And here is a pretty detailed set of recommendations from marketing strategies based on the documents and the picture that I uploaded. So whether you're trying to find some basic information or trying to analyze specific information from your work documents, uploading files to Copilot is a great resource.
### 3. Enable Copilot Inside of Microsoft Productivity Apps with Copilot Pro
#### Clarify subscriptions for using Copilot in productivity apps (4m 2s video)
- The add-on subscription for personal users, Copilot Pro, enables some additional features that we've seen in this workshop, but the main feature enabled by Copilot Pro is the option to use Copilot inside of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, however, there are some details that need to be clarified. First, the full versions of the Microsoft Productivity applications, Word, Excel, and the others, are included with a Microsoft 365 subscription. That is a completely separate subscription from Copilot Pro. So, if you do pay for both a Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot Pro subscription, then Copilot will be available inside of those applications. But if you don't pay for Microsoft 365 and you do pay for Copilot Pro, then how can you use Copilot inside of those applications? Well, the answer is the free online web app versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and that's what we'll see first. So, I'm signed into Copilot with an account that has the Copilot Pro add-on, but does not have a Microsoft 365 subscription. With this same account, I can go to outlook.com and check my email, and I also see buttons for the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint web apps there. Or I can go to onedrive.com to access my OneDrive. That's the online storage tool that is included in most Microsoft accounts. If you have a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file stored on your OneDrive, you can open it here on the OneDrive website and it will open in the Word, Excel or PowerPoint web app. You can do this with a free Microsoft account, and it's a great way to use a version of these apps on the web without paying for the full Microsoft 365 subscription. Here in the Word app on the web, I can see some Copilot tools. When I click to place my cursor in the document, I can see a Copilot button there, and I can click the Copilot button in the Home ribbon at the top to open the Copilot chat panel right here in the document. With this, you could ask Copilot to draft text, or analyze information in the document. More on that in another video. So, if you have a free Microsoft account with no other add-ons, you can access Word, PowerPoint and Excel on the web. If you have the Copilot Pro subscription, you will also find these Copilot tools inside of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel on the web. Now, let's switch over to a computer where I am signed in with an account that has the full Microsoft 365 subscription. On this computer, I have the full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook installed. I'll launch Word, and I'll open the Account menu where I can see that I am signed into my account, which has both a Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot Pro subscription. It's the Microsoft 365 subscription that lets me install these applications, and when I create a new blank document, it's the Copilot Pro subscription that enables the Copilot tools here, including the Copilot button in the document, and the Copilot button in the Home ribbon, which opens the Copilot panel. So, a Copilot Pro subscription gives you the option to use Copilot features in the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook Web apps only. Microsoft 365 subscription gives you the option to install the full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook on your computer, and only if you have both subscriptions, you can use Copilot tools inside of the desktop applications. And finally, I will reiterate that this is how it works for individuals with personal accounts. People with a Microsoft 365 subscription managed by their employer, school, or government agency will have a similar set of features all included in one subscription, but organization accounts like that are covered in a separate course on LinkedIn Learning called Learning Microsoft 365 Copilot for work.
#### Summarize and draft with Copilot in Outlook and Word (4m 8s video)
- Let's take a look at what Copilot can help you do inside of productivity applications. In this video, we will get started using Copilot inside of Outlook for working with email messages, then we'll see how to draft content or analyze information in a Microsoft Word document. I am signed in with an account that has the Copilot Pro subscription. I'll go over to outlook.com, and, of course, I can use Outlook to work with my email. But you'll see there's a Copilot button in the Home ribbon up at the top. Now, in different apps, you will see different Copilot buttons in different places, but there's usually a Copilot button near the top right in the Home ribbon like this one. But I prefer to open an email message to see the options that we have there. When I open a message, I see an option to have Copilot summarize it, and this is particularly valuable with an ongoing email thread like this one, which has replies from several people. I'll click the Summary button to get an overview of the entire conversation without reading each message. And when you reply to a message or compose a new message, you will see that there's a Copilot button in the body of the message. You can click that to get a Copilot prompt where you can ask Copilot to help you write a draft of the response. There are some suggested prompts here, or you can just describe the draft that you want. So I'll write, let them know I'm out of office until next week, and we'll send everything then, and Copilot drafts a response for me. And if it looks good, I can click the Keep It button or I can discard it. Or in the chat field, you can ask Copilot to make a change or just use one of these preset options to make it shorter or longer. This looks good, so I'll click Keep It. I'll make my own changes directly in the draft, and then I can send this message. And if you work in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, there will be Copilot features there as well. Some will work similarly to what we've seen in Outlook, and some will be different. Using the shortcuts on the left, I'll open the Microsoft Word app on the web. If you start a new document, you will see a Copilot field at the top. This is great if you want to ask Copilot to write a draft for you, but you can also click the paperclip button to refer to other files. This does not let you upload files directly, but it does let you use files you already have stored on OneDrive. So I'll click that and choose a PowerPoint presentation from my OneDrive. Then I'll ask it to write a draft referencing information from this presentation. So I'll tell it to write a draft of a press release announcing new products launching this summer. Refer to the products from this presentation. And Copilot gives me a great start on this document. Now, another way to work with Copilot is to start with an existing document. One way to do that is to go to the files you have stored on OneDrive. So I'll go to onedrive.com, and I am signed into the same account, which has the Copilot Pro subscription. I'll choose My Files to see my full list of files, and if I open a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file from here, it will open in the web version of that app. And here in Word on the web, with an existing document open, I can click the Copilot button in the Home ribbon, and that opens the Copilot panel. And I can ask for a summary or for information about the content in this document. I'll ask it to tell me about the KinetEco executives, and Copilot gives me a response based on information it found in the document. And remember the citations, these small numbers that appear in Copilot responses? I can point at one of those, and we see that it did find that information from this document. So you can see the Copilot tools have similar functionality across the different applications. If you work in PowerPoint, you will find similar options. But clearly each application has its own specializations, so there are different ways you can use Copilot. In a separate video, we'll actually look at Excel to see how you can organize and analyze information in a spreadsheet.
#### Analyze data in Excel using Copilot (4m 50s video)
- In this video, we will use Copilot inside of Excel to analyze data in a spreadsheet. It's important to remember if you have a Copilot Pro subscription, but do not have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you will be limited to the Excel web app. But if you do have Microsoft 365 subscription and you do use the desktop application, there is an important additional detail in Excel. So I'll open Excel on my computer. Of course, keeping in mind that you do need a Microsoft 365 subscription to install the full application. I'll open a spreadsheet that I have stored on my computer and I do see the Copilot button in the Home ribbon. But when I click that to see the Copilot panel, it says that I cannot work with Copilot because AutoSave is turned off. The AutoSave option is available in the top left corner, but if I try to turn that on, it prompts me to upload this file to my OneDrive. So here's the point. You can only use Copilot in Excel if the file you're working on is stored in one of Microsoft's cloud storage tools like OneDrive. So if you are using the Excel web app, you won't have this problem because the web app only works with files that are stored online. But if you are using the full desktop application, you will need to upload the spreadsheet to OneDrive first. Then in Excel, when you go to open a file, there's an option to go to your OneDrive there. I do have a copy of that inventory spreadsheet on my OneDrive, so I'll open that and I'll make sure that the AutoSave feature is turned on, and now when I open the Copilot panel, it will work for me. So let's see a few things I can do here. There are some suggested prompts at the top. These are great to get started and learn how Copilot works, but for now, I'll just write a few of my own prompts using plain language. Now, this spreadsheet contains a product inventory, and one of the columns in this sheet is Suggested Retail. So I will ask Copilot to sort by retail price. Now it does not immediately sort the sheet. Instead it analyzes the data, then shows the action that it thinks I want, and this gives me the chance to check what it's suggesting. It looks right so I'll click Apply, and now the table is sorted so the items with the lowest retail price are at the top. And I can always ask follow-up questions and Copilot will remember the context. Next, let's try a filter. In the Category column, I can see that there are lots of different types of products in this inventory sheet. I see inverters, batteries, solar panels, and more. So I'll ask Copilot to filter to only show batteries. Again, it shows me the suggested change, and I'll click Apply. And now it's only showing items that have batteries listed in that Category column. And it's still sorted by retail price, so you can combine sorting and filtering. I'll reset by telling Copilot to clear the filter and I'll apply that change. And let's finish by asking Copilot to analyze this data to show me some specific information. There are several items that have the category of inverters, several batteries, several different types of solar panels and so on. So I'll ask it to show me the total number of units from each category. And now it is showing me this chart, and this is a pivot chart. Now, I don't really know how to make a pivot chart, but Copilot does. I could have asked Copilot specifically to make a pivot chart and that also would've worked, but I didn't need to use that language. It understood the analysis I was asking for in plain language and Copilot suggested a pivot chart. If I wanted a pivot table instead, I could ask for that in a follow-up question. So I'll ask, "Give me that in a pivot table." And here is a pivot table. I want to keep this so I can click this button to add it to a new sheet in this document, and now I have a separate sheet in this document. In that new sheet, I have the table. And when I click somewhere in that table, Excel opens the pivot table controls on the right. So this is a pivot table. If you know how to work with and modify pivot tables, you can do that right here, but you don't have to because Copilot was able to analyze my data based on my plain language requests. I'll click the tab to go to the original sheet in this document, but my pivot table is still saved in that new tab. And from here, I encourage you to experiment with your own prompts or try the suggested prompts to get an idea of what Copilot can do in excel.
### 4. Settings and Privacy
#### How to adjust settings and clear your chat history (1m 58s video)
- There are a few settings and adjustments you may want to be aware of as you work with Copilot. Among other things, we're going to see how to clear your conversation history. First, you can tap or click the account button. You can see which account you're signed into, and you can sign out if you need to. As we saw in another video, you can change the voice that Copilot uses for natural voice conversations. And there is a back button to go back to the main menu. You can also set your preferred language for Copilot conversations. And there is even a choice for a light or dark theme. But there are some settings that are not immediately obvious here in this menu. If you click your name at the top, you get a few more options, including the option to completely delete your account. But let's look at the privacy settings. Microsoft uses information from user interactions to build and improve the AI language models, and they call this training. So the questions you ask and the responses Copilot provides can be used to further train the language models. Some people consider this a privacy concern, so you can disable this to prevent Copilot from using your chats for training. And there's a link to more information on how this training works. You can also control whether Copilot can use information from your Bing searches and other activity associated with your Microsoft account to improve Copilot's responses. And there's also an option to delete or export your Copilot chat history. This takes you to a website where you can export a spreadsheet with your complete chat history or completely delete your history. In this workshop, we saw how to use the chat history to jump back to previous conversations, and if you need to completely clear your chat history, all at once, you can do that here. So those are a few options and settings so you can make sure your conversations with Copilot are private and secure.

## Learning Microsoft 365 Copilot for Work (2024)
### Introduction
#### Explore Microsoft 365's AI assistant (51s video)
- Let AI help you create, summarize, and analyze your documents, messages, and data. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the version of Microsoft's AI assistant that can supercharge your office applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. Copilot and Microsoft 365 also includes the business chat, which is similar to other AI assistants that you've seen, but it can answer questions using private information from your organization, including your messages, meetings, and documents. I'm Nick Brazzi and I'm excited to show you how Copilot can help you be more productive and more creative using secure data from your organization and some easy natural language prompts. A quick introduction is all it takes to get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot.
#### Understand the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription (2m 15s video)
- There are different versions of Microsoft Copilot, including a free version that anybody can use at the website, copilot.microsoft.com. But the version that we are covering in this workshop is Microsoft 365 Copilot. This is a set of AI tools designed to help people in the workplace. Microsoft 365 Copilot is not free, it is a subscription that must be purchased by your organization. First, you must have an existing Microsoft 365 account with a business, school, or similar organization. Generally, this means that your employer or school has assigned a Microsoft account to you and your coworkers, which you use for Microsoft Services and applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. You can see a list of the specific Microsoft 365 licenses that are eligible here on this website. If you are a member of one of these organizations, then your Microsoft administrator can also purchase the license from Microsoft 365 Copilot for you and your coworkers. So if you and your coworkers don't have the Microsoft 365 Copilot features or if you don't know whether you have them, you should talk to your administrator to see if they can add that license. This Microsoft administrator is usually somebody in the IT department at your company or school. So the tools that we will see in this workshop are only for people in an organization, however, if you are an individual not associated with an organization like this, you may want to look into Copilot Pro, that is a separate subscription for individual users, which will also enable AI tools inside of Office applications, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, but for an individual account. Of course, we're not covering Copilot Pro in this workshop, but for more information and context about Copilot Pro and other Copilot products, I encourage you to watch my other workshop called, "What is Copilot? Get started with Microsoft's Everyday AI companion," and if you do have a Microsoft 365 account with the Microsoft 365 Copilot license, make sure you're ready to sign into that account as we go through the rest of this workshop.

### 1. Using Copilot in Office Applications
#### Use Copilot Business Chat with your work data (5m video)
- As we start using Copilot on the web, it's very important that you recognize that things change. Copilot is updated and changed very often. In the past, I would recommend you start at the website, copilot.microsoft.com, but now the tools on this website are really only intended for individual consumers. For business, enterprise and education users, you should go to office.com and sign in with your Microsoft 365 account. After signing in, you'll see a button for Copilot on the sidebar on the left. You can click that and start working with Copilot, or it may be easier to go here directly by going to microsoft365.com/chat or office.com/chat. There's a chat field at the bottom where you can ask questions or make requests, but before we use that, you should look at this switch at the top where you can switch between work or web. If you switch to the web mode, this is similar to the free version of Copilot. This will use publicly available information from the web to answer your questions and your requests. So using the chat field, I'm going to ask Copilot to describe the changes in trends in residential mortgage interest rates in Northern California over the past 10 years. And Copilot can answer that question using information from the internet. Sometimes you will see these small numbers. These are citations, which are links that you can click to take you to the website where it found this information. And these chat conversations are protected with enhanced security that the free version of Copilot does not have. When I point at this shield near the top right, it shows that I have enterprise data protection, so my requests will not be saved and will not be used to train the AI language models, but that's just the web mode. If you switch to the work mode, then questions you ask or requests you make in the chat will be answered using information from your organization. So you can get information about your own calendar, your coworkers, your team communication or files that have been shared with you on OneDrive or SharePoint. This experience is called Business Chat or Biz Chat, and it's one of the main benefits of Microsoft 365 Copilot. So I'll ask a question that can only be answered using information from my organization. This could be something as simple as when is my next meeting? This uses secure information from my calendar to answer that question. But you can also ask questions or make requests related to specific people in your organization or documents that have been shared with you. I'll ask which executives are mentioned in the, then to refer to a specific document, you can type the slash key followed by the name of that person or document, and it searches through all of the documents that you have stored or have been shared with you on OneDrive or SharePoint. It found the document that I want, so I'll select that and send the question. Copilot gives me an answer which refers to a secure document that was shared with me by somebody in my organization, and I can ask follow-up questions. I'll ask if I've ever received an email from any of them. Copilot remembers the context of the previous question and gives me the answer. So now I'm getting information about that shared document along with information about coworkers in my organization and my own email communication. Now, in these responses, I still see citations, these small numbers, and again, this is where Copilot found this information, but it did not find this information on public web pages. It found it in my email. So I can click one of these citations and it will take me right to the email message where it found this. I'll just close this and go back to Copilot. At the bottom of the response, it says three of 30, so I can continue asking follow up questions or just keep chatting with Copilot, and it will remember the context for up to 30 responses. Just make sure you look at this number on your screen because that limit could change in the future. And if you ever want to clear that context and start a completely new conversation, you can click the new chat button up at the top. That resets the conversation and Co-pilot will not remember what you were talking about before. However, you can click this button near the top right to open the chat history panel. Now, this is not a list of individual questions, it's a list of conversations. So I can select one of these to see all of the questions and responses from that conversation, and I could continue that chat from here. With the Business Chat, everything is protected by the security and privacy safeguards in Microsoft 365. You will never be able to access another person's messages, calendar or other private information. Copilot will only show you information that you have permission to access.
#### Generate drafts and modify documents in Word (3m 59s video)
- With Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can use AI tools inside of Office applications. In this video, we will see how to work with Copilot in Microsoft Word. I have a document open in Word. You can click the Account button near the top right and you should make sure that you are signed in with the account that has the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription. With the document open, you should make sure that the Home ribbon is active, then look for the Copilot button in the ribbon. When you click that button, a panel opens on the right. You'll see some suggested prompts. Asking for a summary is a great option, or you can click the chat field and write in a more detailed request. I'll ask if any of the Globe Bank executives have prior experience with other financial institutions, then I'll send that question. So, instead of reading the entire document to find this information, Copilot can find it for me, and Copilot will respond to lots of different prompts and questions, so I encourage you to try some ideas. But here in Word, there is another way to work with Copilot. I'm going to select some text in this document. With that text selected, a Copilot button appears to the left. This gives you a few options. I could choose Make changes, then describe the change that I want. I'll ask if it can make this shorter, then I'll click Generate. So, this text with the blue highlight is the suggested rewrite. If you click Keep it, it will replace the original text with the rewrite, or you can click the trashcan button if you don't want to keep it. The button with a circle of arrows will generate a new version of the rewrite, or you can click this text field, then describe more changes that you want. I'll ask if it can get this down to two sentences with an informal tone, then click the Send button. So, you can try to ask for whatever rewrite you want using natural language, and usually it can help. For now, I don't want to keep this changed, so I'll click the trashcan button. And once again, I'll select that text, then click the Copilot button. And if you choose Auto Rewrite, it will simply attempt to write a new version of this text with no other prompts. You can click Replace if you want to use this rewrite, or simply close this panel if you don't want to use it, or click this Control button at the bottom of the panel to choose the tone you want for the rewrite. For now, I'll just close this panel. And next, I'll scroll to the bottom of the document, then click on an empty line. And again, I see the Copilot button on the left. You'll also see this when you start a new blank document. If you click that, it opens a panel that can help you write a draft. You can use natural language to write whatever request you have, and the draft will be better if you provide more information. I'll ask it to write product descriptions comparing the different solar panel products from the company KinetEco. After typing in your request, you can just click Generate, and of course, Copilot will use information that it finds online to generate a draft. But I'm asking for information one of my clients. Because we are using Microsoft 365 Copilot, it has the ability to search for information from messages or documents in my organization. Or before you click Generate, you can reference a specific file. You can type the Slash key, then start typing the name of the file. And based on what I typed, it found a PowerPoint presentation on my OneDrive, and you can reference as many as three files in each request. But for now, I just want to see what happens if I don't reference a file. So, I'll remove that referenced file from my request, then I'll click Generate. And here's that draft based on information it found from my Microsoft 365 account. You can click the trash can in this panel if you don't like the draft, or click Keep it if you do want to keep it, or use this field to ask for changes. Remember, this information may contain some errors. You should always review and make revisions and only use these drafts as a starting point.
#### Analyze data in Excel (4m 2s video)
- Copilot can help you work in Excel, making it much easier to sort, filter, analyze data, and more. But before we get started, Copilot in Excel will only work with files stored on one of Microsoft's online storage tools. You could use Excel on the web, but if you use the Excel Desktop application, when you open your document, you cannot open a file from your computer. You'll need to open a file from OneDrive or SharePoint. With a spreadsheet open, there is an AutoSave option near the top left. That option is not there if you use Excel on the web, but if you use the Desktop application, AutoSave must be enabled before you can use Copilot in Excel. Next, make sure the home ribbon is active, and you'll see the Copilot button near the top right. You can click that to open the Copilot assistant. There are some suggested prompts at the top, and these are great to get started and learn how Copilot works. And you can also click this View Prompts button for more options. But for now, I'll just write a few of my own prompts using natural language. Now, this spreadsheet contains a product inventory. One of the columns in the sheet is Suggested Retail. So, I will ask Copilot to sort by retail price. Now, it does not immediately sort the sheet. Instead, it analyzes the data, then shows the action that it thinks I want. This gives me the chance to check what it's suggesting. This looks right, so I'll click Apply. And now, the table is sorted, so the items with the lowest retail price are at the top. And I can always ask follow-up questions, and Copilot will remember the context. So I'll tell it to reverse that, and it shows the suggested change, and I'll click Apply. And now, it has reversed the sorting order, so the most expensive items are at the top. And it also offers an Undo button right here in the chat, so I could undo that if it were wrong. Next, let's try a filter. There are lots of different types of products in this inventory sheet. I see inverters, batteries, solar panels, and more. I'll ask it to filter to only show batteries. Again, it shows me the suggested change, and I'll click Apply. And now, it's only showing items that have batteries listed in that Category column, and it's still sorted by retail price. So you can combine sorting and filtering. I'll reset by telling Copilot to clear the filter and apply that change. And let's finish by asking Copilot to analyze this data to show me some specific information. There are several items that have the category of inverters, several batteries, several different types of solar panels, and so on. I'll ask it to show me the total number of units from each category, and now it's showing me this chart. And this is a PivotChart. Now, I don't really know how to make a PivotChart, but Copilot does. I could have asked Copilot specifically to make a PivotChart and that also would've worked, but I didn't need to use that language. It understood the analysis I was asking for in plain language, and Copilot suggested a PivotChart. If I want a PivotTable instead, I could ask for that in a follow-up question. And again, I'll just use natural language. I'll say, "Give me that in a table," and here is a PivotTable. I want to keep this so I can click this button to add it to a new sheet in this document. And now, I have a separate sheet, a separate tab in this document. And in that new sheet, I have the table. And when I click somewhere in that table, Excel opens up the PivotTable controls on the right. So, this is a PivotTable. If you know how to work with and modify PivotTables, you can do that here, but you don't have to because Copilot was able to analyze my data based on my plain language requests. I'll click the tab to go back to the original sheet in this document, but my PivotTable is still saved in that new tab. And from here, I encourage you to experiment with your own prompts or try suggested prompts to get an idea of what Copilot can do in Excel.
#### Create and improve PowerPoint presentations (3m 3s video)
- Copilot can be used in PowerPoint to help you draft new presentations or new slides, or it can be used to make improvements to a presentation that you already have. From the welcome screen in PowerPoint, I will start a new blank presentation. There is a Copilot button above the slides and you can click that for many of the most commonly used Copilot actions. Or when the home ribbon is active, there's a Copilot button in the ribbon. You can click that to open the Copilot panel. Now, you could try one of these suggested prompts. I'll start with one that says, create a presentation about, and in the chat field, I need to finish that sentence. So I'll type best practices for financial management for small businesses, and I'll give it some time to generate something and now I have a starting draft of a presentation created by Copilot. You can think of this as a template, particularly customized for your topic. Even if the information isn't quite right for your presentation, the design or the layout may give you a good starting point. Next, let's make another blank presentation and I'll open the Copilot panel. And remember, the more information you provide, the more effective the draft will be. And a great way to provide that information is to reference a Microsoft Word document that already contains the relevant information. So I'll type make a presentation from then I want to refer to a document that I already have. You can type the slash key followed by the name of a document and this searches through your documents from OneDrive or SharePoint. It found the document that I wanted, so I'll select that, then send the request. So that made a new presentation using the information from the Word document that I provided. And Copilot can also help you add individual slides. I want to add a new slide after slide number three, so I'll select slide three, then I'll ask the Copilot chat to create a slide about choosing a financial planner and now I have that new slide. Take a look at the draft text to see if you can revise the draft for your needs. But even if the text isn't right, this is usually a great way to get a layout or a picture that matches the slide that you want to build. And finally, I'll open a presentation that's already built so we can use Copilot to modify an existing presentation. I'll open the Copilot panel. You may see the pre-made prompts to summarize the presentation, and if not, you could type that into the chat box. You can ask direct questions about the content of the presentation, or maybe you have a long presentation with lots of slides and you want to add some organization. So I'll ask Copilot to organize this presentation and when that's finished, you can look at the list of slides on the left and see that they are now grouped and organized in sections. These sections are defined by the content in those slides, and you can click the arrow next to each section to open or close it. So try these options and experiment with your own prompts to make new presentations or improve the presentations that you already have.
#### Draft and summarize messages in Outlook (3m 11s video)
- Copilot in Outlook can help you draft email messages or get summaries of messages that you've received. Copilot works in Outlook for Windows, Outlook for Mac, and even Outlook on the web. First, I'll select a message in my inbox, and above the message, there is an option to summarize it using Copilot. Now, this may not work on some very short messages, and it's really most useful when you have an ongoing conversation with several messages and replies, like this one. So I'll click that button to get the summary, and instead of reading through all the messages and replies in this conversation, I can read the summary and I will probably find the information that I need. Next, let's compose a new message. I'll add somebody to the recipient field, then type in the subject line. And when you're ready to actually write the message, Copilot can save you time by writing a draft for you. First, make sure your cursor is in the body of the message, and in the ribbons at the top, make sure that the message ribbon is selected. Then you should see the Copilot button, and when you click that, a menu opens and you can choose Draft with Copilot. Or there's another way to do this. Back in the body of the message, before you type anything else, you can type the slash key to open this menu, and you can choose Draft with Copilot here. And in this field, you can describe the draft that you want. The more detail you give, the more effective the draft will be. So I'll type, "We'll be posting job listings for new financial advisors soon. Write an email to Stewart outlining the main requirements for this role." Then I'll click Generate. Take a close look at the draft that it generates. If you need something different, you can click the Retry button and that will generate a new draft based on the same prompt. There's also a button here, which opens a menu where you can make changes to the length or tone of the draft. You may see this button, or you may see these options in another menu, depending on whether you're using Outlook on Windows or on a Mac. When you have a draft that you like, you can click Keep It, and it places that text in the body of your email message. Now, you should always review and revise these drafts. In this case, Copilot found the information it needed from the internet. But I have a nice structure to the draft and some very useful information that I can use as a starting point. And finally, Copilot can help you revise messages that you write yourself. So I'll go to my drafts folder and open a draft that I was working on earlier. So I've already typed my message here. And at the top in the message ribbon, I'll click the Copilot button and choose Coaching by Copilot. This will review the text that you've written and may give you several suggestions for how you can improve your message. You can review these edits, or if you just want to apply all of the suggested changes, you can click the Apply All Suggestions button. And if you want, you can click the Replace button to replace your original text with this revision. These tools have the potential to really streamline the time you spend in Outlook by summarizing incoming messages and helping you write the messages that you send.
#### Leverage several Copilot tools in Microsoft Teams (3m 43s video)
- There are several Copilot tools in Microsoft Teams. So let's take a quick look at some of those features. First, Copilot can help you revise messages that you write in Teams. So you could start from a team channel and click the button to post a new message, then type your message. And at the bottom of the message field, there is a Copilot button which opens the Rewrite panel. In the Adjust menu, you can choose a different tone or length, or you can simply click Rewrite to see the revision that Copilot suggests. If you don't want to keep it, you can just close this panel, or you can click Replace if you do want to keep the revised version. So you can do that in a team channel. Or if you go to the Chat section and select a chat conversation, you'll see that same Copilot rewrite option is available for messages in a chat as well. Next, we'll see how Copilot can help you by offering summaries or answering questions about your chat conversations. So I'm already in the Chat section, and I've selected this conversation with my coworker, and I'm looking for some specific information that we've discussed in the past. Instead of scrolling back and reading through all of these messages, I can ask Copilot. I see the Copilot button near the top right, and that opens the Copilot panel. And you can ask for a summary or ask it to find action items from your conversation. I'll ask it to give me highlights from the past 30 days. And I get a summary of everything we've discussed recently. Now, you can also click more prompts to see more suggestions of things that you can ask, but I'll ask a direct question. I'll ask: What is the status of the Kineteco contracts? And it answers the question and even includes citation links. I can click a citation to go to the exact message where it found that information. And you can also ask follow-up questions, and you can have an ongoing chat conversation with the AI. And finally, you can use the business chat inside of Microsoft Teams. When you're in the Chat section in Teams, there's a big Copilot option at the top of your chat list. This is completely different from the Copilot button that we used inside of a chat with a specific person. When you select this big Copilot option, you can chat directly with Copilot itself. So this is not giving you information about a specific conversation. Instead, this is Business Chat. Remember at the beginning of this workshop when we were on the Copilot website and there was a switch for work or web? When you choose the work mode, you can ask questions about your schedule, your teammates, your documents, and other information in your organization. And this is the same experience you get when you choose the main Copilot chat in Teams. This is Business Chat. So I'll ask it to summarize the marketing review meeting this week. And it gives me that summary using private secure information about a meeting I had in Teams with my coworkers. And by the way, asking for a summary of a meeting like this will only work if that meeting was recorded. Now, you are not limited to questions about your organization here. I could ask something like: How is the weather in London? And Copilot can still answer that question using information from the public internet. But take a look at this: you can click the Plugins button in the chat field, and you see that I have the plugin for web content enabled. If you do not want Copilot to use information from the public internet here in the Business Chat, you can disable this plugin. So if you spend a lot of time working in Microsoft Teams, this may be your best way to work with the Business Chat.
#### Get summaries of meetings in Teams (3m 45s video)
- In another video, we saw several Copilot features in Teams, but there's one more feature we need to see. Copilot can offer AI recaps and summaries of meetings in Teams. So I'll go over to the calendar section and I'm going to start a meeting, and for now, I'm just going to be in a meeting alone, but we can still see everything that we need to see. And I'm going to resize the window so we can see all of the buttons up at the top. For Copilot to offer an AI summary of your meetings, you will need to record those meetings. To do that, you can click the More button up at the top, then go to Record and Transcribe. So I have the option to start a recording or start the transcript. I'll just click on the option to start recording, and it tells me that both the recording and the transcription have started, and that's what I need. If the transcript is not running, you should make sure you go back to that menu and start the transcription. The AI assistant depends on that transcription to find information for you. Also, that recording and transcript must run for at least five minutes before the AI will have enough material to work with. Now you can feel free to close this transcription panel if you don't want to see it, and it will still be recording in the background. Or you can go to the More menu, to Record and Transcribed, and you can choose Show Transcript if you do want to see it. Now at this point, anybody in the meeting can click this Copilot button up at the top. It will open up the Copilot panel and they can ask questions using the chat field. So you could ask for a summary of the meeting or you could ask what you missed if you joined a meeting late. Or you can ask about specific topics discussed in the meeting. But the way most people use this is to get a summary or ask questions after the meeting has ended. So I'm actually going to leave this meeting, and of course the recording will stop when everybody leaves the meeting. After a meeting has ended, there are a few ways to get to the AI summary. One option is to go to the Chat section, so you can select the Chat button on the sidebar on the left, and your meeting will probably be listed here along with your chat history. Here is the meeting that I just left, but this is a meeting that I had with some of my coworkers earlier today. This one is more interesting. So you can select the meeting that you want to see information about it, including the transcript, or you can open the recording from here. Or if you don't see the meeting listed here, that's no problem. You can go back over to the calendar section, and you may have to use the arrows in the top left to skip back through the calendar to when that meeting happened. But once you find the meeting on your calendar, as long as the meeting has ended, you can double click it to see information about it. And you get the same summary options. So you can open the recording or the transcript from here. And at the top, there is a recap tab. And here, you can see the AI generated notes, which summarize the major points discussed in the meeting. Copilot uses the content of the recording and transcript to generate these notes. You may find what you need here in the AI notes, but you can also ask the AI direct questions about the meeting. I see the Copilot button in the top right, and I can click that to open the chat panel, and ask a question that Copilot will only be able to answer using information from the meeting transcript. I'll ask, what are the challenges our banks have faced with the new online banking system? And Copilot is able to answer that question based on the meeting transcript. So with the Microsoft 365 Copilot license, you have the extra ability to ask questions or ask for summaries in the AI chat while the meeting is still in progress, or from the recap tab after the meeting is finished.

## Copilot in Word: Create and Refine Documents with AI
### Introduction
#### Use Copilot in Word (34s video)
- CoPilot is your everyday AI companion in Microsoft Word. Whether you're writing a business proposal, drafting guidelines, composing a letter, or reviewing a lengthy document, CoPilot can help you brainstorm ideas, strengthen your writing, analyze documents to give you key takeaways, and much more. And you can accomplish all of these tasks just by chatting with CoPilot using plain conversational language. Hi, I'm LinkedIn Learning Senior Staff Instructor, Garrick Chow. And in this course we're going to look at some of the most useful ways you can have CoPilot enhance your writing and boost your productivity.
#### Understand the Copilot subscriptions (2m 15s video)
- [Instructor] The name Copilot is used by Microsoft for several of their products and services. So before we jump into this course, I want to take a moment to clarify how the name applies to this specific course on using Copilot in Microsoft Word. First we have a free version of Copilot. Anyone can use Copilot on the web by going to copilot.microsoft.com to ask questions, draft text, and generate images. There's some limitations to the free version of Copilot, such as the number of prompts you can use per day being capped, and the responses from Copilot potentially being a little bit slower. But again, anyone can use this web-based version of Copilot for free without an account. But the free version doesn't allow you to use Copilot in Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so on. To use Copilot through those and other M365 apps, you have to have a paid subscription to Copilot through either a personal or individual account or an account through your work or school, also referred to as a business account. If you're subscribing as an individual, you'll be subscribing to Copilot Pro, which is currently $20 a month. And you can see that one of the features of Copilot Pro is you can access Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps, which is not available through the free web-based version of Copilot. Now, if your Microsoft account is through your work or school, that's considered a business account and the subscription for business accounts is called Microsoft 365 Copilot. In most cases, if you have your subscription through work or school, your network administrator or IT department will set up your Copilot subscription for you and you'll see Copilot when you open your Microsoft 365 applications without having to do anything yourself. Alright, so that's a quick overview of the different Copilot subscriptions. For this course, just bear in mind that you must have either a Copilot Pro or a Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription to see Copilot in Microsoft Word. Now there's actually a lot more to what the term Copilot encompasses. If you'd like to learn more about what Copilot entails across Microsoft's products and services, including more about the web-based version of Copilot, be sure to check out my colleague Nick Brazy's course, What is Copilot: Get Started with Microsoft's Everyday AI Companion.
### 1. Creating with Copilot
#### Draft a new document from scratch (6m 28s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot is a great resource to have at your fingertips when you're staring at the proverbial blank slate, wondering where to start with the document that you need to create. I've started up Word, and let's create a new blank document. When you first do this, you may see some of these Copilot prompts above the document. We have things like Produce insights from file, Create a proposal based on file, Draft a business memo, and clicking on any of these automatically starts a prompt in this prompt area. So when you write a command or request to an AI, what you're writing is called a prompt. Now, we're not going to get too deeply into all the best practices of prompt writing in this course, but as a general rule, it's a good idea to be clear about what you want to provide some context and to be as specific as possible. So for example, let's say I'm a manager. and I want to create a document to help guide my employees through the process of writing their annual self-reviews. To have Copilot help me draft this document from scratch, I might write something like, "Act as a manager and generate a set of guidelines to help employees write their annual self-review, provide a checklist of items for employees to work through, keep the language and tone of the document professional." So here I'm telling it to take on the perspective of being a manager, and I'm telling it what I want, a checklist my employees can follow to guide them through their self-evaluations, and I specified that the tone and language should be professional. Now, given that I told it to act as a manager, the tone and language would be pretty professional, but I like including these kinds of instructions so there isn't any doubt about what I want. All right, so I'll come down here and click the Generate button and see what we get. And there it is. So just like that, we've gone from blank page to this multi-page formatted document. So for my brief prompt, it's generated sections like the Introduction, Guidelines for Writing Your Self-Review, which is broken down into Reflect on Your Achievements, Be Honest and Objective, Use Specific Examples, and so on. And we have a conclusion at the end. Now, of course, even though this generated document can apply to any number of organizations or roles, it's a good idea to always consider Copilot-generated content as a first draft, and to always read every word it generates to make sure it applies to your situation and to customize it to suit your needs. Notice it even says here in the prompt window that AI-generated content may be incorrect. So never just take what it generates and send it out into the world without reviewing and rewriting it yourself. Now with that said, if the results weren't quite what you were looking for or if you want to make a slight change, Copilot can continue to help you. We'll talk more about revising and refining text in the next chapter. But some things you can do after generating your content include coming down to the prompt window, and here we have a Keep it button, which you can click if you're happy with the results. If you want to try again, you can click the Regenerate button and it will go through the entire process again, giving you slightly different results from the same prompt. So now we have a new version of the document to check out, and the great thing about this is you can come down to the prompt window and use these arrows to switch back and forth between the different versions to see which one you prefer to use as the starting point for your document. Now, if there are elements of both that you like, you might want to copy and paste them into a separate document, but in this case, let's say I like version two, so with that selected, I'll click Keep it. And now I have the starting point for my document to work with. Again, we'll look more closely at revising and rewriting content in the next chapter, but for now, that's just one example of using Copilot to draft a new document from nothing. From other blank documents, you could have Copilot draft a letter or generate an article or a social media post. In fact, for some examples of prompts you could use, from the Home ribbon, we'll click the Copilot button to open up the Copilot panel. This is another area where you can write your prompts, but this is more for taking advantage of Copilot's abilities, like chatting, answering questions, and so on. We'll be spending more time in this panel later. But you can see here that we have some prompt starters, like Summarize this doc, Create an image, Tell me more about the references this document makes, and so on. And you'll often see additional prompts down here at the bottom, like, Summarize this doc and Is there a call to action? Also down here, you can click the View prompts button, which gives me this window with some prompt examples for creating content, Write more confidently, Find specific information. We can also click this Tasks menu to narrow down the types of prompts we want to see here. And that gives me some ideas, like Craft headline candidates Create FAQ, and so on. So I could start with one of these, like Create FAQ, which places a prompt into the prompt field that I can then customize as needed. Or, of course, I could just create a new blank document and I can write my own prompts at any time. By the way, if you click into the document and just start typing, and the Copilot prompt field at the top disappears, I can just delete that, and that gives me this Copilot icon in the margin, and clicking that brings these prompts and the prompt field back at the top. And you can always open up the Copilot panel and type your prompt here as well. So for example, maybe this time I'll say, "Generate a list of do's and don'ts to follow when writing a self-evaluation for work." And then I'll click the Send button to have Copilot respond to this prompt. And there it is. Now, unlike using the Copilot prompt in the window of the document itself, using the Copilot panel keeps the responses in the panel, so I can review the content here without affecting my document. But if I like what it's generated, I can click the Copy button and then paste that into my document. All right, so that's using Copilot to draft a new document from scratch. Now, you can also give Copilot documents you already have to use as a reference for information or to match their tone when drafting new content, and we'll see how to do that next.
#### Create a new document using files as references (3m 5s video)
- [Narrator] As we previously saw, you can use Copilot to generate documents completely from scratch. But if you want Copilot to generate content and match the tone and style of your writing or your organization style, you can have a reference up to three existing files that it can use when creating your new document. For example, I have here the social media training manual for Globe Bank International. This is a 28 page document, covering the guidelines for posting on various social media platforms. Now this file is saved on my OneDrive, which is important because if you want Copilot to be able to access and reference a document, and it can be a Word document or a PowerPoint file, but that file has to be saved in your organization's OneDrive or SharePoint. So with that in mind, I'm going to close this and open up a new blank document. And here at the top in the prompt area, I'll tell it that I wanted to draft a document of guidelines for employees posting to LinkedIn. Include an introductory section, explaining the importance of following the guidelines and a conclusion at the end, summarizing the document. Now here, I'm going to click the Attach button to allow me to reference my content. When you click this, you should see a list of the most recent documents in your OneDrive. Now, if the one you want appears here, you can just select it. Alternately, notice it placed a slash here in the prompt area, and it says you can start typing the name of a file for Copilot to work with. So I could start typing that file name to locate the file that I want to use. Once I see it, I can select it. Now do note that sometimes it takes several minutes or longer for your files to show up here. So if you only recently saved a file to your OneDrive a few minutes ago, you might not see it right away, but you can enter its full name here after the forward slash, even if it doesn't show up right away. And Copilot should be able to find and reference it. But in this case, I did see it, so I was able to select it. And again, you can add up to three files to reference. Now notice, nowhere in my prompt did I mention that these guidelines should be for employees of Globe Bank specifically, but let's click the Generate button and see what we get. And there it is. And even though I didn't mention Globe Bank in my prompt, notice the document does mention the company name. So we know the Copilot did in fact reference the document I selected. Now, as with the document we previously created completely from scratch, you always want to carefully review what Copilot has generated, even from referenced files to check its accuracy, scope, and tone. And again, we can come down here and click the Regenerate button to have it give us another variation of the document, or if we like what it generated, we can click Keep It, and we can start working on this document from here. So be sure to take advantage of this ability to reference your existing files with Copilot to improve and enhance the content it generates for you.
#### Produce additional content in a document (2m 9s video)
- [Instructor] Whether you're working with a document that Copilot generated for you, or you're working in a document you're composing yourself, Copilot can help you figure out what comes next or add more to your document. For this example, I've opened up a version of the document on guidelines for writing an annual self-review that we previously generated. And maybe after reading through this document, I think I could use some more content to help employees write the reviews. So I'll come down here and add a line before the conclusion and then I'll click the Copilot button in the margin. Notice when working in a document that already has content, we have this Inspire me button. This can come in handy when you're not sure what to write or add to your document and clicking it will have Copilot examine the surrounding text and generate some related content. In this case though, I kind of know what I want. So I'm going to type in my prompt and we'll say, "Create a section with the heading of example questions and generate a list of questions that employees can answer to help them write their self-evaluations. Include a brief introduction explaining how to use the questions, maintain the tone of the document, and reference other sections as necessary." So again, you want to be as specific as you can with your prompt to ensure that you get the content that best suits your needs. So, for example, I specified that the intro paragraph for this section should be brief and it should try to maintain the tone of the document. We'll click Generate, and there we have it. Copilot has created this new section that fits with the rest of my document. It's created the heading Example Questions just like I asked, and I can see this bulleted list of questions it came up with. And that's before we can keep it regenerate or delete it. Now you can also refine what is written by typing in the prompt area. So if you wanted to change the tone or tell it to add more questions or to shorten the intro paragraph, you could do so from here. In this case though, I'll just keep what it generated and then I could come through here and edit and format it as necessary. And now we've used Copilot to add this new section to our existing document. Again, be sure to always review and edit any content generated by Copilot, but this is a great starting point.
#### Generate images for your document (2m 13s video)
- [Instructor] In addition to generating text, Copilot can also generate images for your documents. This could be useful if you need a specific image to illustrate a section of your document, or if you need to come up with some ideas for some office layouts and want some images to look at, or you simply can't find the image you need on the web or with stock images. For example, here I have a document about the origin of Globe Bank and I want an image to go along with it. I'll open up the Copilot panel and down here in the prompt area, I'll ask it to generate an image of a bank on a small hometown street, the image should be warm and inviting. So just as with prompts, you write to generate text, Copilot will give you the best results when you provide descriptive prompts. So instead of just saying, give me an image of a bank, I added more details like what kind of bank it is, where it's located, and the tone. We'll click send. And after a moment, Copilot gives us our options. So we can see these by selecting them and then clicking Insert and we can see that adds it to our document. I can undo that and maybe select a different one. And once you're happy with an image, you're free to move it around, resize it, and arrange it how you like on your page. Now, in addition to generating images, Copilot can also pull up stock images as part of your Microsoft 365 subscription. Just specify that you want a stock image by typing a prompt, like add a stock image of a board meeting and we can see the ones that's found here and there it is. So Copilot can find all kinds of stock images and if it can't find exactly what you need, you can ask it to generate images for you.
### 2. Editing and Revising with Copilot
#### Adjust the tone in existing content (2m 56s video)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, we're going to look at some ways Copilot can help when you already have some content in your Word document, but maybe you don't like the way you worded a sentence or paragraph, or you want to strike a more casual tone. For this example, I have a draft of an article about the origins of Globe Bank, and let's say I'm not really happy with this second to last sentence here that says, "Still at its core, Globe Bank International remains a community bank, focusing on the specific needs of individuals and organizations in each community in which its branches are located." And I want to come up with some alternate versions of what I've written. So I'll select that text and that gives us our Copilot icon in the margin. We'll click that. (mouse button clicking) And because I have some text selected, as opposed to in the previous chapter, when we were generating content on blank lines, we have the choice here to Write a Prompt, Auto Rewrite, or Visualize as a Table. I'm going to choose Auto Rewrite, and that gives us three options to choose from. We have Globe Bank International remains a community bank, addressing the needs of individuals and organizations in each local area. A slightly longer sentence here. And yet, a third variation. Now if I like any of these, I could simply click Replace, and that replaces the selected text without alternative. Let's undo that. And I'll click the Copilot button and choose to Auto Rewrite again And again, we get three different options. Now, sometimes you'll like one of the options, but not so much that you want to entirely replace your select text. Maybe you like some elements of both what you've written and what Copilot is generated. In those cases, you can click Insert below. So now I have both versions of the sentence, and I could spend some time writing a version that combines them together. Let's just undo that again, and I'll ask for another rewrite. (mouse button clicking) And the rewrite window also has this prompt area. And from here you can specify what you want Copilot to change or keep about the selected text. For example, you might want to specify what tone you want the rewrite to strike. Maybe I want a friendlier tone, so I'll say, keep the tone friendly. So it takes that into account when doing this rewrite. And maybe I like that. But I also want to expand this to emphasize our role in the community. And it's now generated this extra paragraph on the role the bank plays in the community, supporting small businesses and so on. So you have a decent amount of control over how Copilot rewrites your content. And again, if it generates something you like, you can choose to replace the existing version or insert it below and continue revising it.
#### Convert text to tables (1m 56s video)
- [Instructor] If you think some text in your document would be better presented as a table, instead of you having to manually create a table and copy and paste your text into it, Copilot can do this for you. I'm currently working with a version of the annual self-evaluation document we generated earlier, and here under the Guidelines for Writing your Self-Review section, we have several bullet points. Each bullet point has a step followed by an explanation or example of how to follow that step. Let's see if this information can be more effective when presented as a table. So, I'm just going to select that entire list. I'll click the Copilot icon, and choose Visualize as a Table. And there it is, Copilot has taken that information and converted it into a table with a column for the Steps and a column for the Details of each step. And as always, you can click the Regenerate button if you wanted to take another try. And you can see in this case, it actually benefited me because now I see we have three columns, Step, Action and Details. So, if it didn't do quite what you wanted, you can always click that Regenerate button and see if it does a better job. And as always, you can toggle between the versions to see which one you like, and you can also further add to the table using the prompt area. For example, maybe I'll say Add an empty fourth column because maybe I have an idea for another column I can add to this table. And there it is. And I'll click Keep it, and now I have this table in my document. So, that's how to use Copilot to convert text into a table in Word.
### 3. Summarizing and Understanding with Copilot
#### Summarize and understand documents (4m 3s video)
- [Instructor] In addition to being extremely helpful with documents that you compose yourself, Copilot can also come in handy when you need to read or review other documents, especially particularly lengthy documents. So here I have an annual report from H+ Sports. This is a 13 page document and if I scroll through, you can see it contains multiple sections. So this is a lot of information to take in and maybe I'm short on time or I only need certain information from the document. Let's open it up the Copilot panel. And down here at the bottom of the panel, I'll select the "Summarize this doc" prompt. Now this part may take a while depending on the length of your document. Also, as of this recording, Copilot is limited to processing up to 80,000 words in a single query. If your document is longer than that, you may have to break it into separate documents or select just the section you want to have summarized. But this document is only about 4,600 words, so Copilot can handle that easily. And now it's given us the summary of the main ideas of the report. So now I can read a short summary of the sections that Copilot feels are important. Now, this doesn't cover everything we saw in the document when we scrolled through it, but we can ask follow up questions for more information on the information Copilot provided or we can ask about parts that it didn't mention. So for example, maybe I want to know more what's covered in this section on diversity and inclusion. So I could type something like, "Summarize the diversity initiatives covered in this doc." And there it is. When providing summaries, Copilot will usually include references. Notice the numbers that appear in the summary. Rolling over the numbers tells me what page it got that information from. And clicking one will take me to that section of the document, with that section briefly highlighted. Note that as always, the copy button appears here. So you can click that to copy the summary Copilot generated and paste it into another document or maybe an email to share with colleagues or anyone who needs that information. But you also might find that you need to have a little more back and forth with Copilot to get more useful information out of the document. You can often get better results by providing more context or asking more detailed questions. For example, I might ask, "What are the key takeaways for stockholders in this document?" And now we've extracted things like the important financial information from the document. Or as another example, maybe I want to know, "What are the action items related to the sustainability initiatives in the doc?" And there's that summary. And even if you're not sure what to ask, notice there are prompt suggestions right below the summary. Like, "Can you provide more details on the employee gardens?" And, "What are the benefits of using organic fibers for clothing?" And you can click on any of those to ask that question. Now lastly, you can even have Copilot generate new content based on the document. For example, maybe I need to share the main points of the document with my teammates, and I could write something like this, "Summarize the main points of the doc in bullet points, and include an intro paragraph on why they're important to company employees." And now I have a summary of the document, but with the added context of the value of this information to employees of the company. So let's a quick look at how to summarize documents and dig deeper with Copilot in Word. Again, be aware that Copilot usually does better the more you chat back and forth with it. If it doesn't give you the results you want right away, try asking your question in a different way or add more details or parameters to your prompts.
#### Research details to support your document (2m 16s video)
Research details to support your document
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] When working on a document, Copilot can be a useful research assistant. Instead of switching to your web browser or another app, you can try asking Copilot questions to help support or enhance your document. For example, I'm working on the Globe Bank social media manual here in Word. And in this section called Platforms We Use, the manual offers suggestions about each major social media platform and what to post to them. I'll open up the Copilot panel. And maybe I want to add some practical information to the section on LinkedIn, like, "What is the ideal resolution for a LinkedIn profile photo?" Notice it says it's combing through web results, documents, and emails that it found relevant. So Copilot has performed a web search to find this info, and it didn't pull this info from the document we're looking at. Now, again, like with all things Copilot does, be sure to check its accuracy. But with this information it's provided, I could copy and paste it into my document and revise it as necessary. Or maybe I want to ask Copilot a more open-ended question to make sure I'm not missing or forgetting anything in this section. So I'll ask it, "What other platforms or information should be included "in the Platforms We Use section of this document?" And here's Copilot's reply. And again, I might not use all or any of this information, but this is useful to me to make sure I haven't excluded any important platforms from this document. Maybe we don't use Pinterest or Snapchat but we do have a TikTok account, so I'll need to come up with something for that. I will ask to generate a guideline on how Globe Bank should use TikTok, and base your response on the other social media platform descriptions used in this document. And there's the response. And now I can use what Copilot has generated to help me write the company's guidelines for using TikTok.

- [Narrator] There exists a prevalent myth that artificial intelligence or AI is akin to magic, all powerful and requiring no skill to wield. This is far from the truth. To fully leverage AI, such as Copilot and Excel, a solid grasp of Excel's core functionality is not just helpful, it's imperative. Before embarking on your Copilot journey with this course, it's essential to master what I consider the rites of passage for Excel proficiency. This includes lookup functions like VLOOKUP() or XLOOKUP() as well as analysis capabilities like PivotTables. A fundamental understanding of how to manually prepare and analyze data in Excel as also crucial before you can expect AI to effectively augment these tasks. Specifically, hands-on experience with Excel tables is highly beneficial as Copilot utilizes them extensively. You should be familiar with creating and formatting tables using foundational operations on them, such as sorting and filtering and understanding structured references for data analysis and manipulation. A grasp of AI concepts, including natural language querying and machine learning basics can also refine your interaction with Copilot. Familiarizing yourself with how algorithms process information and learn from examples can enhance your use. This does not require advanced mathematics. An intuitive understanding is enough, which you can acquire through practical learning. There are plenty of resources available for non-experts to gain this foundational knowledge, including my own LinkedIn Learning course on AI-Powered Excel and Michael McDonald's AI in Business Essential Training. Copilot is designed to amplify your productivity in Excel by collaborating with your existing skillset. The blend of AI assistance with your human insight can transform how you work. But to make the most of this technology, your Excel and AI basics must be solid first. Remember, AI performs optimally when it compliments human intelligence, rather than replaces it.
#### Working with Excel tables (3m 49s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot in Excel unlocks a world of opportunities, especially if you're new to Excel. Here's the catch though. To fully leverage Copilot, you need to use Excel tables and structured references, which use table names and column headers instead of traditional cell addresses. Many enthusiasts eager to dive into Copilot often haven't used Excel tables before, so this video will guide you through them ensuring you feel confident using tables alongside Copilot. We'll use an exercise file named working-with-excel-tables for this demo, which includes a neat data set of book sales. Although it looks organized, we can enhance it by converting it into a table. To do this, select any cell within the data set. Navigate to Insert table or use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+T or Ctrl+L. (mouse clicks) A create table dialogue will appear asking you to confirm the data range and whether your data has headers. Confirm these details and click okay. (mouse clicks) Immediately you'll notice aesthetic upgrades like banded rows, simple yet effective improvements. But here's the key, table data requires a different analysis approach than usual. In tables, Excel doesn't use the standard cell references like A1 through B22. Instead, it references table names and specific rows or columns. This makes it crucial to have clear, understandable names for your columns and table. Usually, your first table is automatically named Table1, which isn't very descriptive. So let's change it to something more meaningful like book_sales. The table name should be a single word without spaces or dashes. (mouse clicks) (keyboard clacking) With a descriptive name, referencing becomes clear and more intuitive. Next, let's create some formulas using this table. You'll notice that formulas and tables look and function differently than those in regular cells. Let's add a calculated column first. Suppose we want to calculate total sales by multiplying quantity sold by price per unit. First, name the new column as sales in cell F1. As you enter this, Excel automatically extends the table format to this new column. For the calculation, instead of using cell references like D1 times E1, use structured references for better performance. To do this, use the left arrow key to navigate to the appropriate columns in the same row. Columns are referred to by their names with the @ symbol indicating the current row. (keyboard clacking) Now, what if we want to aggregate the data for the entire table? Instead of single cell references, the notation will change. For example, if you total up the sales column using either your mouse or keyboard, you'll start with basic references, but then we'll see the table and column names appear once completed. (keyboard clacking) So familiarize yourself with these table notations independently before integrating Copilot. This foundational knowledge allows you to fine tune and audit Copilot's outputs more effectively. I encourage you to start organizing your data into tables now, not only for their aesthetic appeal, but also for their compatibility with advanced tools like Copilot.

Getting your data into Copilot
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] While designed to be a straightforward, user-friendly tool, setting up Copilot requires a bit more than merely opening Excel. Let's explore the setup process in this video. The exercise file for this demonstration is titled 01_01_getting_data_into_copilot. I have a basic dataset here that contains information about the five boroughs of New York City, and I'd like to test drive Copilot using this data. First, I'll navigate to the Home section on the ribbon toward the right, I notice the Copilot icon, however it's currently grayed out, and I'd like to discover why. If you encounter this issue, consider the following guidelines. First, ensure your data is stored in a table. Tables are versatile tools, and while it's beneficial to understand their intricacies, for now, simply click inside the dataset and press CTRL+T for Windows, CMD+T for Mac. Click OK, and the data is now stored as a table. When I return to the Home tab, I can see that this approach wasn't effective. The icon is still gray. So let's navigate to File, Save as, and Verify the file's format and storage location. It should be saved either as an XLSX or XLSM file and stored on either OneDrive or SharePoint. Both conditions are satisfied in this case, so that's not the underlying problem either. What else could be causing this issue? Well, Copilot requires an active internet connection, so make sure you have that as well, and I do. Another aspect to verify is that auto save for your workbook is activated. Let's switch it on for this workbook, and there we have it. The Copilot icon is illuminated and ready for use. We'll delve deeper into the subsequent steps of getting started in the following video. If you're still experiencing difficulties with activating Copilot in Excel, consider closing all active sessions and reopening your workbook. As you familiarize yourself with the process starting a successful Copilot session will become second nature. It's likely that over time the steps will be better documented and more user-friendly. Until then, keep this troubleshooting guide handy and you'll be proficient with Copilot in no time.

- [Instructor] In the previous video, you successfully set up a data set to use with Copilot in Excel. Now let's explore Copilot's features. The exercise file for this tutorial is 01-02_copilot_tour. We'll again be using the New York City population data set. First, if your Copilot icon is grayed out, once again ensure that your data is saved as a table in either OneDrive or SharePoint. Make sure auto save is enabled, then navigate back to home and select Copilot. On the right side, you'll notice Copilot in a docked popup menu. Upon accessing the menu, you'll encounter various options. You'll observe that Copilot categorizes its functionalities into four primary sections: Add formula columns, Highlight, Sort and filter, and Analyze. Selecting these options prompts Copilot to address questions related to that specific use case. We'll use these menus throughout the course. These options aren't exclusive to our current location though. Click on the star icon at the bottom of the menu and you'll rediscover them accompanied by a fifth: How can Copilot help? Clicking on it will generate a prompt in the chat inquiring about Copilot's assistance and providing an example link. This link redirects you to Microsoft's official page introducing Copilot for Excel. Given the rapid evolution of this product, bookmarking this page for future reference might be a good idea. Now let's experiment with some of Microsoft's recommended prompts for Copilot. Examples include, "Show data insights", "Show suggestions for formula columns"; and, "How can I highlight, filter, and sort data?" I'll select the first option, Show data insights, and Copilot responds. Now, here I receive a histogram showing the frequencies of population. I will add this to the sheet, and if you see something different than this, don't be alarmed; this is just part of how Copilot works. You may get different results each time you prompt Copilot. This is where your guidance becomes crucial. Helping Copilot deliver more useful results. We'll build on the skill throughout the course. For now, simply click Go back to table to return to the data source and continue using Copilot's default settings. Copilot's power lies in its interactive nature, which encourages you to refine prompts for increasingly precise results. For example, here Copilot suggests finding a percentage of total population for each borough. Again, if you see something different, don't hesitate to follow along with what Copilot gives you and use your best judgment. I'll click here, and it looks like Copilot suggests we add a column to this table, which is a skill we will address later in the course As we delve deeper into Copilot and its various features, you might notice that the suggestions and results Copilot offers you differ from those in these tutorials; this is not a bug but rather a feature of Copilot. Being an AI tool, Copilot heavily relies on probability in its operations, leading to variations in its behavior. Expect the unexpected and be ready to improvise. Your ability to adapt while using Copilot in this course will greatly enhance your readiness for real world applications.
#### Basic table reformatting with Copilot (2m 59s video)
Basic table reformatting with Copilot
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Narrator] Excel tables offer a wealth of benefits, not the least of which is their aesthetic appeal. With a couple of clicks, you can transform your data set into a beautifully formatted table, complete with banded rows, filter buttons, and more. Copilot elevates this experience, making it incredibly easy to alter your table's appearance once created. To follow along, open the exercise file named 01_03_table_formatting, where you'll find the NYC boroughs table we've been using. You can also go ahead and open Copilot. The first thing that stands out about this table is that the population column lacks a comma as a thousand separator, making it challenging to read. I'll fix this by asking Copilot to format the population column with a thousands comma separator, no decimals. Hit Enter, or click the message icon to send. And now this column is much easier to read. Let's see what else we can tweak. Given that this is New York City data, I'll format the text using the Broadway font. While I wouldn't typically recommend this font for data display, it's okay to have a little fun with fonts while learning. Generally, a simpler Sans Serif font like Segoe UI or Roboto works best for clear, readable tables. For now, I can undo this change for readability with Ctrl+Z or click Undo in Copilot. Next, I'll make some changes to the appearance of the table's headers and footers. While filter buttons are useful, they can be obtrusive, so I'll request Copilot to remove them. And presto, they disappear. By default, Excel tables don't include totals. However, adding them in with Copilot is straightforward. When a total does get incorporated into an Excel table, it starts by summing up the last column. Unfortunately, Copilot isn't proving to be especially helpful in modifying the total row at the moment. The most effective method remains utilizing the dropdown menu available in each total cell. There are numerous other formatting options you might consider, such as changing colors, adding borders, and more. While Copilot excels in some of these areas, others might require manual intervention. For experienced Excel users, these tips might seem basic. You probably already know how to apply formatting changes using keyboard shortcuts or menu options, which might even be quicker than using Copilot. However, the real beauty of Copilot lies in its ability to intuitively understand and execute your commands, regardless of their complexity. The idea is to simplify your workflow by merely typing out your requirements. Starting with formatting might seem elementary, but considering its significance in data analysis, it's an excellent place to start.
#### Using Copilot in Excel for non-Excel tasks (4m 43s video)
Using Copilot in Excel for non-Excel tasks
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] Let's explore how Copilot in Excel is more versatile than you might think. It's not just for your typical Excel chores, like formatting or basic calculations. Nope. Copilot can actually assist with tasks outside the usual Excel grid. Before delving into this topic, let's consider why Copilot is capable of handling subjects beyond Excel in the first place. The reason lies in the extensive training of the models that Copilot is built on underwent on a vast corpus of text data, far exceeding Excel-specific content. And, unlike some other generative AI programs, Copilot incorporates robust security measures to ensure that your data remains secure within your organization. To see this in action, open the Use Copilot Non-Excel Tasks Workbook. To get started, we'll load our table into Copilot, but here is the kicker. We don't actually have to stick to typical Excel tasks here. You can use it for fact finding too. For instance, let's say you're planning a Jazz Age book promotion and need to confirm novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald's birth date, ask Copilot, and voila, you've got your answer without even leaving Excel. (keyboard keys clacking) To continue with this, you can ask Copilot anything you'd ask a more general AI tool. Want to know about the population of Long Island, New York, in the 1920s, when Fitzgerald's "Great Gatsby" was set? Go ahead and ask. You might not get a perfect answer, but it's a great starting point for further exploration. (keyboard keys clacking) Copilot can help with basic tasks involving text as well. Need to proofread an email update on your sales report? Copilot's got your back right from within Excel. No need to switch to your email client. (keyboard keys clacking) And get this, Copilot can even summarize text data, not just numbers. Let's say you need a summary of some bookstore reviews. Copilot can handle that too. (keyboard keys clacking) Now remember, Copilot in Excel is primarily for Excel tasks. If you need more general AI assistance, there are better platforms out there, namely Microsoft Copilot. But for those of us deep in Excel every day looking for quick help with contextualizing data or managing emails and reports, this little Copilot hack can be incredibly helpful.

(upbeat music) - [Instructor] Now that we've begun exploring Copilot together, it's time for you to try it out on a dataset for yourself. The task at hand involves the exercise file named 01_ 04_ch01_challenge, which contains a typical sales dataset with columns like the date of sale, price, and quantity. Your mission is to navigate some initial steps with this dataset. Start by preparing the data for use in Copilot. You can follow the instructions provided in the Getting Your Data Into Copilot video for reference. Once you have the data in place, focus on improving the table's formatting. To address the issue of dates appearing as serial numbers in Excel, you should reformat the date column to display dates in the month/day/year format. Next, address the formatting of the price and sales columns by setting them to currency. You may need to format each column individually within Copilot. You may also remember that every table comes with an optional footer row that can be turned on. Go ahead and do that so we can easily see total sales. Finally, adjust the table's font size to 30 to enhance readability. Proceed with these steps in Copilot and feel free to explore additional features that may benefit the dataset's appearance. I'll meet you in the next video to go over the results.

(upbeat music) - [Instructor] I hope you enjoyed taking your first independent steps with Copilot. Now it's time to reconvene and review your solutions by comparing them with mine, which you'll find in the exercise file named 01_05_ch01_solution. To begin ensure all the necessary steps for using Copilot are in place. In my example, I've saved the file to One Drive and converted the data into a table. However, I missed one crucial step, turning on auto save. Once that's done, we'll be ready to utilize Copilot effectively. My first task is to refine the date column. I'll instruct Copilot to convert the formatting to month, day, year, making the data much easier to read. Although the situation with the price and sales columns isn't as critical, formatting them as currency is still a wise move. I'll have Copilot format these columns to display currency, managing to format both simultaneously. Following that, I'll direct Copilot to append a total to our table. By default, it will add a sum to the bottom of the last column, which fortunately is our sales column, precisely what we want. Finally, I will request Copilot to enlarge the font size to 30 for the table data. Currently, this change will not affect the headers or total rows, but feel free to adjust those manually in the Excel editor as you see fit. This formatting feature is not only a sleek and considerable time saver for those who are not well versed in Excel's shortcuts and menu navigation. It also represents just the beginning. Copilot boasts an array of functionalities, which we will delve into in more detail in the next chapter.

Creating Formulas and Functions Faster with Copilot
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] Formulas and functions are at the heart of Excel, and if you thought that AI would keep you from ever needing to write them yourself again, well, you're halfway there. Let's explore how Copilot can significantly streamline the process of crafting formulas and functions. Refer to the Exercise File 02_01_formulas_functions to follow along. Again, to get started, I'll click inside the table, navigate to the Home tab, and launch Copilot. The first step I'll take is to click the option which allows me to add a formula column. Let's see what we can do here. I'm not loving the Status column being entirely in uppercase, so I'll request a column formula to convert it to proper by typing: "Add a column to convert Status to proper case." Now here, I am given a PROPER function to create the new column. Again, you may retrieve something different. I will click Explain formula to learn more. And if you're satisfied with the results, click Insert column. Let's continue to experiment. The Size column indicates measurements in ounces. I aim to convert this to cups. And I'm not sure about the exact conversion rate and wonder if Copilot can help, so I'll make the following request: "The Size column is in ounces. Could you convert it to cups and label the new column as Size (cups)?" Here, I'm given another column to insert. You may be asked by Copilot to create the formula yourself or given another approach. So again, be flexible and experiment with the results given to you by Copilot. Let's insert column. And lastly, I want to aggregate data from one of the columns. For example, I wish to determine the average price across all items. By prompting Copilot with something like: "What is the average of price?" A suggested PivotTable emerges. Now, here we have the opportunity to add this PivotTable to a new sheet. Copilot is telling us it is not able to find the price, but the results were given here. Again, this is a new and somewhat experimental feature of Excel, so make sure to use your best judgment in formulating and evaluating your results here. Let's add to new sheet. And the result is returned as a PivotTable. It's worth noting that Copilot often favors PivotTables over standard formulas and functions to deliver results. So again, be flexible and make sure you have your Excel basics down with both formulas and PivotTables. In conclusion, while your days of manually crafting formulas aren't entirely behind you, the process will undergo a transformation. With Copilot, much of the heavy lifting is handled, enabling you to oversee operations akin to a supervisor monitoring an assistant adept in both formulas and PivotTables.
#### Debugging Excel formulas with Excel Copilot (5m 22s video)
Debugging Excel formulas with Excel Copilot
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] If you've ever wrestled with a stubborn Excel formula or tried customizing a VBA script from a tutorial to suit your needs, you'll understand the hurdles of debugging. Copilot for Excel steps in to alleviate these headaches by suggesting corrections to your formulas and scripts. However, there are times when it's more efficient to start anew rather than modify existing code. Whether you're debugging an old formula or crafting a new one, Copilot is here to guide you, enhancing your Excel skills and ensuring your projects are not only effective but also streamlined. You can follow this process using the exercise file named copilot-debug-formulas. In our first example, I'm tackling the task of calculating a running total in the sales column and hitting some snags. I suspect mixed referencing is necessary, but it's proving tricky to implement correctly. Here, I'll have Copilot review my formula and identify the errors. (keyboard clattering) Interestingly, Copilot suggests a novel approach by introducing a new column, which I will add to my worksheet. It doesn't tweak our existing formula, but offers an entirely new one by using structured table references. This is a departure from the alphanumeric references that many users might be used to, but it's vital as Copilot requires data to be formatted as a table. This is why understanding table structuring is so crucial before you dive deep into using Copilot. If you're struggling with a specific formula, like getting an averageif function to operate correctly, you can paste that directly into Copilot and ask for help. (keyboard clattering) Sometimes, Copilot might suggest writing the formula from scratch, which can lead to unintentionally adding a new column to your table. If it's not what you want, simply copy the result to another part of your workbook. This demonstrates the dual paths available within Copilot, collaborating on new formulas or seeking debugging support for existing ones. Often, beginning refresh is easier, but sharing your current challenges such as any errors you're facing or goals that you have can provide Copilot with the insights needed to better assist you. And keep in mind, this is not limited to table calculations or aggregations on a table. The same principles will apply if you need help with VBA macros, for example. The more unique your script, the more direction Copilot might need regarding your specific requirements. In this scenario, I'm going to include the problematic macro, outline the issues, and then see how Copilot can resolve them. (keyboard clattering) And here we have a corrected macro set up for us to use. Whether you're ironing out bugs or starting from scratch, Copilot provides the essential guidance to sharpening your Excel skills and ensure your projects are robust and efficient. Yet remember, while Copilot is a fantastic tool for refining and troubleshooting, sometimes, a clean slate is the most straightforward solution.

Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Instructor] This course has explored using Copilot and Excel to enhance your productivity. Now let's talk about a related product that you might find equally handy, Microsoft Copilot. Microsoft Copilot extends beyond Excel, providing a comprehensive generative AI experience across all Office applications and more. While Copilot in Excel focuses on enhancing tasks within your spreadsheets, Microsoft Copilot offers additional functionalities to broaden your productivity horizon. For deep dive into Microsoft Copilot, I recommend checking out Nick Brazzi's LinkedIn learning course, Streamlining Your Work With Microsoft Copilot. Now, assuming you're using the paid business version, Microsoft Copilot uses your workplace data to generate insights and answer queries similar to what you've seen in Excel. It keeps your data secure within your organization, even as it accesses vast amounts of information trained on the GPT algorithm. So let's kick things off here without any exercise files. Just fire up Microsoft Copilot and follow along. Remember, your results will differ from mine since it customizes its responses based on our individual data. First up, let's throw out a general question to see how it can assist us in Excel. Let's ask, "What are some ways I can use you as an Excel tutor?" From my experience, it will provide some neat ideas and even links to relevant sources. (keyboard rattling) Next, why not dive a bit deeper? It's fascinating to see it generate a mini tutorial tailored just for your data. (keyboard rattling) Moving beyond specific functions, let's explore broader concepts like the differences between Office Scripts and VBA. When I used my own files to inquire about this, the explanation was a bit general, but still quite informative. (keyboard rattling) Next, imagine starting a project from scratch where you need help identifying key performance indicators or KPIs, setting up processes and more. Here, Copilot is invaluable. For example, if you want to track customer feedback from your consulting engagements, Copilot can guide you on which metrics to monitor and how to efficiently collect and analyze that data using tools like Forms and Excel. (keyboard rattling) (keyboard rattling continues) (keyboard clacking) (keyboard clacking) (keyboard clacking) Finally, you can also get help with specific Excel files. Right now, there isn't a straightforward way to upload or directly refer to files in Copilot. You can use the dash sign here and get some recently used files. But you can still ask it to try and identify a specific file in your repository, and I've had more luck with this. For example, I will ask it to search for the wages.xlsx workbook, and it usually manages to find it. (keyboard rattling) Once Copilot has located the file, I can ask it to help me get started with something like creating visualizations. (keyboard rattling) The possibilities here are vast, from creating VBA scripts to deciding on visualizations or designing a dashboard. And it's all personalized to your data in a secure work environment, making it a fantastic complement to Copilot in Excel for broader strategic planning and help with Excel.
#### Data profiling (3m 17s video)
Data profiling
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Lecturer] Data profiling is similar to a chef examining ingredients to ensure quality, a crucial step for preparing delicious dishes. This process ensures that your data is primed for analysis, with Copilot acting as a skilled assistant, intuitively assisting with each step. To try data profiling in Copilot for yourself, head to 02_02_data_profiling, which is a slightly adapted version of the famous palmerpenguins dataset. Beginning with fundamentals, one might query Copilot about the number of rows found in the dataset. Now, here I'm given the result as a response directly inside Copilot. You may also be given a PivotTable containing the number of rows. In either case, you should get 333. This is the number of rows without the header from the table. Next, I'm going to check for the possibility of any outliers in the body_mass_g column. I will add this resulting scatterplot to my sheet. And by posing this question to Copilot, we are presented with the scatterplot that suggests an anomaly, particularly in relation to the flipper_length_mm column. This scatterplot exposes a penguin allegedly weighing a whopping 10,000 grams, which is a deliberately fabricated figure for illustrative purposes. If you spot an outlier through a chart like this or perhaps other output that Copilot gives you, a good next step is to scrutinize that suspicious data entry even further using techniques such as sorting or filtering, topics we'll explore later in the course. But for now, I will head to Go back to table and try to make sense of our categorical variables next. For example, I see an island column, and I just want to double check how many islands are actually represented in this dataset. I'll ask Copilot to find the unique values in the island column, and there they are. I could add the results in a PivotTable to my worksheet, but I'm going to get even more specific with Copilot and ask for a distribution of the island column. Now, using this prompt, I will get both a chart showing the number of penguins found on each island, and I will also get a description here. So again, make sure that you are experimenting with your prompts and seeing what Copilot has to offer given different questions you pose to it. You can also use this approach with quantitative variables. For example, requesting the distribution of body_mass_g prompts Copilot to generate a histogram, enabling the detection of potential outliers. In the hands of those versed in its powerful features, Copilot transforms Excel into a more potent and intuitive tool for data profiling, allowing you to unveil the full narrative of your data.
#### Sorting and filtering data (2m 52s video)
Sorting and filtering data
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Frederic] Head to the exercise file 02_03_sorting_filtering. Here we have some information about a particular product line. I want this data sorted and filtered by price, category, and so forth. I'll fire up Copilot, and the first thing I'll do is head to Sort and filter, just to confirm to Copilot what it is we want to do here. We'll start by sorting by price from high to low. You'll see that Copilot understands and responds to this query, and you'll even see that the sort button on the header has been manipulated. So it's clear that the data has been sorted. Let's say I want to sort first by status, then by price, so that all the active and then the discontinued SKUs are grouped together. When I submit a query to Copilot, for whatever unstated reason, Copilot is unable to deliver the desired results. In such instances, it's beneficial to refine your prompt to be more specific. For instance, I'll adjust my request to specify sorting by the status column from A to Z, followed by sorting the price column from high to low. Despite these adjustments, it seems Copilot is still not meeting the request. This situation underscores the importance of having a basic understanding of Excel. That enables you to compensate for areas where Copilot may currently fall short. Okay, let's move on to filtering. Maybe instead of moving the discontinued SKUs to the bottom group, as with sorting, I want to hide them entirely. So let's tell Copilot to filter out rows where status is discontinued. If you're all done with this view and want to remove all filters, simply prompt Copilot to clear them. Want to sort and filter at the same time? No problem. Here I'll ask for rows where status is equal to active. Then I'll sort by variety. Now again, here's a case where I asked Copilot to filter rows where status is active. It gave me the opposite result of discontinued. So use your best judgment and make sure you're aware with what Copilot is giving you. I'll go ahead and use the filter button on my own end to set status to active. As you can see, Copilot transforms data sorting and filtering in Excel from a manual process into an intuitive natural language driven interaction, enabling analysts to swiftly organize and scrutinize their data for better insights.
#### Working with multiple tables in Copilot (6m 30s video)
Working with multiple tables in Copilot
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- [Speaker] I often say that good data, much like money doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It takes real effort to gather, and a big part of this in data involves pulling together data from different sources. Combining data from different places can be a daunting task that shakes the confidence of many Excel users. The complex mazes of VLOOKUP, and now XLOOKUP can be confusing, but here's where Copilot steps in to change the game. Let's take it for a spin with the exercise file, copilo-multiple-tables. In this example, we're looking at New York City's population by borough for each decade. The catch is that it's sorted by borough ID and not by the name. While using IDs like this can be computationally useful, it can get tricky when you're trying to work with the data in a practical sense. This is where Copilot can really shine both as a short-term helper and also as a long-term guide to efficiently manage multiple tables. Let's put it to the test. First, I'm going to select the population table on the left of the worksheet and then open Copilot. To start, I'm going to ask for the population of Brooklyn in 1990. Without the borough IDs properly aligned here, this could be tough to figure out on your own. But with Copilot, we get our answer in a flash. Think about how useful this could be, pulling up data in a snap before a meeting, or just before you wrap up for the day. Next, let's dive deeper than just fetching a single data point. I'm going to ask Copilot to draft an XLOOKUP function to pull details from the borough's table. I will be specific about the tables and the formula to use. This does assume you're somewhat familiar with how XLOOKUP works. It really highlights the to have a solid Excel foundation in place before diving into what Copilot can do for you. Once Copilot crafts a function, you can copy the formula into your worksheet or insert it into your table. For instance, if an unexpected borough ID like six pops up as it does in our data here, you'll receive an NA error, which is not something you might want in a report or during calculations. So to fix this, I suggest tweaking the Copilot prompt to handle unmatched values by filling them in with "Other." I will insert the improved formula into our workbook. Getting troubleshooting like this right means being precise with your instructions and really understanding what you need from your data and how Excel can help you. Lastly, what if you wanted to use relational joins and Power Query instead of XLOOKUP to merge these data sources and wanted Copilot's help? While Copilot can't automate every step of Power Query yet, it can guide you through the process with quite a bit of accuracy. Again, the key here is clarity. Specify your tables, the fields to merge and more. Copilot will then steer you through the necessary steps to accomplish the merge. Visibility to work with multiple tables marks a significant leap in what Copilot can do. While it's mainly been limited to working within single tables, it's now savvy enough to handle multiple tables simultaneously, bringing it closer to the everyday realities of any analysts who rarely have all of their data neatly in one place.
#### Challenge: Enhancing a table with Copilot (1m 8s video)
(upbeat music) - [Instructor] Great job on taking additional steps in this exciting journey with Copilot. It's time for another knowledge check. The exercise file for this one is 02_04_ch02_challenge, which contains the same product sales data set as the challenge from chapter one. Let's build on the work you accomplished with that data and with Copilot. First, I would like you to add a total sales column that calculates the product of price and quantity. Although this field was part of the last chapter's dataset, it's probably best as a calculated field anyway. After you've added the calculated column, proceed to hide the price and quantity columns in the worksheet. Next, use Copilot to count the number of products in each category. Here's a tip, requesting the distribution for the relevant column is an effective approach. The final task is to arrange the dataset by total sales in descending order. Good luck, and remember, you're always welcome to experiment with your own queries and methods as you explore the data further. I'll catch up with you in the next video.
#### Solution: Enhancing a table with Copilot (2m 49s video)
(electronic music) - [Instructor] Welcome back. This challenge was centered on using Copilot to facilitate initial steps of data manipulation. Let's proceed with the exercise file named, 02_05_ch02_challenge. The first step is to generate a sales column. I'll instruct Copilot via the prompt guide to add a Total Sales column that multiplies price by quantity. Copilot generates a formula, price times quantity, let's insert that into our table. Next, I no longer need to view the quantity and price columns, so I will hide them from my worksheet. Now in this case, it looks like Copilot is having trouble doing this. Manually, you could try another prompt. Let's see what I have here, "Hide the quantity column." I will try to do this one at a time and see if that helps. I did use the word columns instead of column. We'll see if that affects its results here. Okay, the quantity column is now hidden. So in a case like this, when you're having issues with Copilot fulfilling your request, try to break it down into individual steps. So I'm going to go ahead and do that again. "Hide the price column," singular, and it looks like breaking that down into individual steps was enough for Copilot to understand. Okay, let's continue on. My next goal is to count the number of products in each category. I'll direct Copilot to generate a visualization, showing the category distribution. This results in a bar chart that clearly shows there are more electronics, products and home goods, and if you'd like to insert this into your workbook, you can do so with "Add to a new sheet." I'll continue on here and sort the data. Let's sort by total sales in descending order. Very good, our data is now much easier to understand and we've done some initial exploration. Did you achieve similar results to mine or did you find any other interesting insights? In any case, nice work using Copilot for data profiling and exploration. Through this exercise, you're now ready to progress to the next phase of analysis, all thanks to the assistance of Copilot.

### 3. Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Copilot
#### Conditional formatting (2m 33s video)
- [Instructor] "At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question, 'Compared to what?'" This quote by data visualization legend Edward Tufte captures a fundamental principle of data interpretation and analysis. Within Excel, conditional formatting is an invaluable tool toward this end, enabling users to explore data variations and trends with ease. Even better, Copilot streamlines this process remarkably. Access the exercise file for this video, 03_01_conditional_formatting, which contains data on the fifteen largest cities in the United States. Let's start with straightforward conditional formatting techniques. Get started by selecting Highlight from the menu of options in Copilot. To start, I'll highlight each city that is also a state capital. By instructing Copilot and specifying the highlight color, the task becomes more efficient. The same principle applies to other formatting styles, such as emboldening the three highest population density figures. Similarly, we can underline the values corresponding to areas ranging from 300 to 400 square miles. Excel offers a wide range of conditional formatting options to enhance your data representation. For instance, we can introduce blue data bars to signify population figures. When you need to manage these conditional formatting rules, like deleting, editing, or modifying, Excel's legacy tools are your go-to resource. Navigate to the home tab, select the Styles group, and choose Conditional formatting > Manage rules from the ribbon. From here, you can make any changes as desired. While asking Copilot to modify specific conditional formats often yields unsatisfactory results at this time, you can effectively use it to remove all conditional formatting from a table. By leveraging Excel and Copilot for conditional formatting, you can transform complex data sets into compelling visual narratives, facilitating immediate understanding and enabling quicker, more informed decisions.
#### Advanced data analysis and insights (3m 33s video)
- [Instructor] Now that you've used Copilot to enrich, clean and even visualize data, let's look at some ways to generate and summarize insights using a combination of these methods. The exercise file for this video is 03_ 02_advanced_data_analysis. Here we have some sales data. Let's say I'm an analyst at this organization and my task is to analyze the data for any identifiable trends and relationships. I'll start Copilot. And this time under the prompt guide, I'm going to select the last option, Analyze. Copilot is now primed to explore the table for insights. For example, I can ask it to visualize total_sales by month of order_date, and I get a nicely formatted line chart here. I'll get a pivot chart summary of the data. Let's add this to the sheet to confirm if it looks right and it does to me, we can go back to our table and ask Copilot for more. Let's say I'm interested in digging into sales for a specific month. For example, I want to get total_sales summarized by product category in June, 2016 of order_date. In this case, Copilot generates a PivotTable summary for me. I can add it to a new sheet, and you'll see here we get a warning that if our data changes, make sure to ask Copilot for an updated answer. So some of these results are not going to update if your data updates in Copilot. This is usually the case when you're not given a PivotTable or a formula back. So just be aware of that shortcoming here. I'm going to go ahead and head back to our table and continue on. So far, we've analyzed total sales as a general trend and by specific categories. This time I'm going to combine this approach and see if we can find top selling categories for each month of sales in this data set. So my prompt here will be a little bit more involved. We'll ask, what is the most popular product_category by sum of total_sales for each month of order_date. You'll notice that I'm being very specific here about which columns I want by calling them out specifically by name, I'm even explicitly telling Copilot how to aggregate the resulting data. For example, it should be a sum rather than an average. This is going to leave far less ambiguity for Copilot to know how to proceed with this analysis. Here, again, we get a nicely formatted result. I will add this to a new sheet, and this is yet again, a table and not a PivotTable. That means that any updates in the data are not going to be automatically reflected. We will need to run Copilot again to get an updated answer. I hope you're seeing that Copilot can save you loads of time in analyzing your data, but you've got to make sure you're being very specific with asking Copilot for what you want. Otherwise, you can easily get misleading or even incorrect outputs in return for your prompts.
#### AI-powered data visualization with Copilot (2m 57s video)
- [Instructor] Data visualization is vital for simplifying complex data, uncovering patterns, and effectively conveying findings to others. However, beginning a data visualization can be daunting. With so many chart options available, it can be challenging to determine the best starting point. Fortunately, Copilot can provide assistance by offering suggestions that inspire deeper analysis and improve visual representation. Consider the exercise file 03_03_data_visualization, which again contains data on the fifteen largest cities in the United States. We'll begin by graphing the population of each city. Copilot suggests a bar chart, which seems like a solid choice. I'll add this to a new sheet and you'll see the results formatted here. I'm going to head back to Copilot, and let's continue prompting. We can continue the analysis by experimenting with different data aggregations. For instance, we might instruct Copilot to instruct the average city area by is capital versus not capital. Copilot gives us a summary of the data generated. We also get a chart here that again we can add into our workbook. Now you notice that Copilot frequently favors bar charts in these situations, demonstrating an important principle of data visualization that while the urge to innovate for novelty's sake is strong, it's not necessary to be overly elaborate without cause, so we'll stick with the basics as Copilot does with a bar chart. They're a standard choice because of their simplicity and effectiveness in various contexts. I'm going to go ahead and continue here. Let's examine a situation where the bar chart might not be the best choice. For example, this could be when illustrating the relationship between two quantitative variables, such as area and population, and I'll do that in Copilot now. In this case, a scatterplot is more appropriate, which Copilot promptly provides. I can add this to my sheet and confirm the results. Currently, Copilot has limited functionality for customizing these plots, but Excel gives users full control over the process. For example, I might want to add a trend line to the scatterplot to examine the correlation between city area and population. In summary, Copilot facilitates the data visualization by suggesting efficient and straightforward chart types like bar charts and scatterplots. It emphasizes that utility often trumps the need for novelty, leaving room for users to refine and personalize their visualizations.
#### Introducing advanced analysis with Python for Copilot (6m 53s video)
- [Instructor] As the worlds of data analysis, data science, and generative AI converge, one language stands out as a glue holding them all together, and that's Python. Python has even been integrated into Excel, allowing you to run the language directly from your workbooks. While this alone was impressive, adding Copilot into this mix creates something truly magical. In this video, we'll explore how this combination works. Now this does mean we will be coding with Python and using Python code. So if you're new to it, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with Python in Excel first through the LinkedIn Learning Library. To follow along, you can download the exercise file Advanced Analysis: Getting Started. I'm going to launch my Copilot on this penguins data set just as I would with any other data set for Copilot. I will scroll up here and there is now a new set of commands. Here it says Advanced Analysis. Let's click on this edition to Copilot. We are going to get a couple of warnings here. This is going to create a new sheet for the results. It's going to automatically write and insert our Python formulas. And then from there, what we can do is custom prompt and it will continue to answer our prompt with multiple messages. So this is going to start basically a new thread of Copilot. Let's start our advanced analysis. Click the button and we're off here. You'll see, first off, the data is going to get read into Python. We are going to get a preview of the data here. You're going to see that a lot of this output you'll see in two places. First, inside of your worksheet, there is also a log of what's being done here. So it looks like in this case, all Copilot really did was load the data into Excel. Again, Copilot can work in a lot of different ways. You might get different visualizations if you run this. Some of you may get different descriptive statistics or other methods for exploring the data. So it really just depends on what Copilot decides to do, and you're certainly welcome to close your workbook, open it again, and see what Copilot gets that time. Now that we're done with this initial exploration from Copilot, we're free to ask it whatever we'd like about this data set and Copilot will continue generating our Python code, placing it further down in the workbook. So for example, I'm going to ask Copilot how many missing values are in each column of the data set. (keyboard clacking) Okay, so Copilot was able to give us the results. We see the Python code. Here, we're not going to get too much into actually modifying and looking at this code. There are some great courses on Python in Excel in the library. You'll also see over to the side, you'll get a preview of what was done. You'll get a summary of what happened in that analysis. You'll also get some suggestions here about what may be some good new avenues to explore once you've looked for missing values. What's great here is that I can continue to add onto this prompt and get exactly what I want. So for example, maybe I want this expressed as a percentage, I could go ahead and ask Copilot to do that. (keyboard clacking) And Copilot was able to return those results in a percentage rather than the whole number. So you could continue on exploring this data and doing your exploratory data analysis. But let's go ahead and move on to actually running a predictive analysis of this model. So for example, I'm going to ask Copilot if he can help us build this model. (keyboard clacking) So you'll see, I'm going to be specific about what I want it to predict, what variables to use. You can make this more open-ended. Again, just keep in mind that you need to be aware and cognizant of what Copilot is actually doing. I'm going to run this, we'll see what we get, and then we can regroup on the results here. So we will see here that Copilot does indeed build us a predictive model. It is giving us some statistics, telling us things about what the precision recall and F1 score are. If you're not familiar with these terms, then that's a good sign that you may want to learn a little bit more about predictive analytics and building these types of models. Just running it with Copilot and Python is one thing, but really interpreting the results is something else here. Last but not least, let's try to build a plot here or a visualization as we have not seen one of those yet. I'm going to ask it rather at a high level (keyboard clacking) to visualize the relationships in this data set. So we'll see what Copilot can do here. See how creative it can be. And again, keep in mind, what you're seeing from me might be completely different than if you ask the script of Copilot too. So it looks like Copilot went with what's called a pair plot. What we're seeing here, and let's make this zoomed out here, we are looking at the relationships between each quantitative variable. We see the distribution of that variable along the diagonal. I kind of like to think of this as like a visualized version of a correlation matrix. We can also see that Python went and split the data points by species. So that just gives us a little more of a breakdown, and you can see that there are some pretty clear differences across species when it comes to these quantities. So there are a lot of different things to explore here. Really cool that we're able to build some visualizations and analyses that otherwise would have been pretty difficult in Python using just simple natural language. Of course, it's really important that we understand what these outputs are, we understand how these models work. The future with Excel, Python, and Copilot is really, really exciting. I hope that you see that here with advanced analysis.
#### Time series analysis with advanced analysis in Copilot (5m 5s video)
- [Instructor] Time series analysis allows organizations to identify patterns, trends, and fluctuations over time. These insights are essential for accurate forecasting, strategic planning, and informed decision-making. Although Excel has traditionally faced challenges with time series data, integrating Python within Excel has expanded its capability significantly. In this video, we'll delve into conducting time series analysis using Python and Excel, empowered by Copilot and advanced analysis. You can start by downloading the exercise file, advanced analysis time series start, which contains monthly shampoo sales data spanning over three years. We'll input this data set into Copilot and initiate a Python powered analysis. Let's head to Copilot. We will go to advanced analysis and let's start the advanced analysis. Now, again, these results are very unpredictable. I couldn't tell you what Copilot is going to give us this time. It looks like we are getting a visualization in this case. We are going to get some statistics now it looks like, and now the analysis is done. Good idea to briefly scroll through here. Understand what we're doing here, exploratory data analysis. Okay, we're getting a plot of sales by month. We are getting descriptive statistics for shampoo sales. Things like the average, the median and sales forth for monthly sale. Okay, so that makes sense to me. Let's dive a little bit more into the descriptive analysis here. So for example, maybe we are interested more so in sales by quarter than sales by month. I'm going to ask Copilot to give us a chart showing total sales by quarter. (keyboard clacking) Okay, now it looks like Copilot was able to make quick work of that. Let's scroll out here a little bit and you will see that this quarterly plot has been created. You can dive into the Python code that was used to generate it either over here or you can dive right into the worksheet and see the code that was generated directly in that worksheet. Okay, now this is called advanced analysis, so we're not going to stop at just exploratory plots. One next step we might want to do is to examine the stationarity of the dataset. If you're not familiar, and time series means that the statistical properties, things like the mean and the variance things that we actually just looked at in an earlier step remain consistent over time. And this is really important because many forecasting models are going to assume that our dataset is stationary to ensure accuracy. So let's have copilot assess the stationarity of this data. (keyboard clacking) Okay, so Copilot was able to do some diagnostics here. It's running something called a Dickey-Fuller test. It is giving us things like P values. So if these terms aren't familiar to you, again, it's a good idea to make sure you understand the methods that are being used by Copilot and by Python before you just take this and and run. In this case, it is telling us that this data is not stationary. Let's go ahead and continue on here and get co-pilot's opinion about what we should do next. So again, my goal is really to build a forecast here. I know now that the data is not stationary, although it would be a good idea just to kick the tires on this and understand at a deeper level how Copilot and Python got to that decision. But let's just take this as correct for right now. So I'm going to ask Copilot, given what you found about this data not being stationary, what sort of model might be good to forecast sales over the next four months? So this is kind of an open-ended question for a Copilot, and we'll see what it gives us. Great, so we do get a result here. It's suggesting that we use what's called an ARIMA model. This is a pretty common forecasting technique, autoregressive, integrated moving average is what that stands for. We are able to build this model again using Python code generated by Copilot, and we see those predicted values there. Time series analysis, traditionally a challenging area for Excel has become significantly more powerful with the integration of Copilot and Python. However, again, make sure you fully understand the models and techniques being used before presenting them as definitive solutions to your team.
#### Text analysis with advanced analysis in Copilot (7m 59s video)
- [Instructor] Excels text processing capabilities, particularly for tasks like natural language processing, have traditionally been limited, but the introduction of Python in Excel significantly expands these capabilities. And now with Copilot and advanced analysis, gaining insights from text data becomes much more accessible. To follow along with this demo, you can open the advanced-analysis-text-analysis-start workbook. We're going to be working with a well-known movie review data set, which contains 50,000 movie reviews, preclassified as either negative or positive in sentiment. We'll start by using Copilot to pass our data into advanced analysis and see what we can uncover. Let's head to Copilot and we will go to advanced analysis. We'll see the same messages here. Let's start our advanced analysis. And again, what you see here might be completely different than what I get. So let's roll the dice and see what happens. Now, almost every instance of advanced analysis, or really every instance I've seen, starts with just reading the data in from the table that's done up here with the XL function. If you see that from this first cell in the report here. You can learn more about how Python and Excel gets data from Excel with Python and Excel courses from the LinkedIn library. We do see a preview of the data set here. So just to make sure that this data has been read properly into Python in Excel, and now it looks like it is going to attempt to perform some exploratory data analysis on the reviews. Okay, so it looks like Copilot has completed our analysis here. And again, you could continue with some of these suggested prompts. Let's take a look at what the output logs as it were here. We see a bit of information about what Copilot gave us. Visualizations, here are the visualizations. We'll go over those in just a second, but I do want to see something here. You'll notice that there actually was an error that Python threw when executing the code generated from Copilot. So Copilot generated some code, Python ran it. Python encountered an error, and Copilot is actually smart enough to take that error and rewrite it and tell you what the error was and you probably don't care, right, 'cause it's fixed. But that just goes to show how intelligent these tools are, right? That they're able to really fix their own mistakes here. Let's go ahead and move down here to the resulting plots. So the first one, we get a bar plot. It's showing us the distribution of positive versus negative reviews. It displays it as a proportion. So we're looking at like a 50/50 split of positive versus negative reviews. That could be really good to know if we're trying to build any predictive models, we want to have a sense of how common it is to result in either category. So it looks like it's about 50/50 there. Okay, review length distribution. So this is pretty interesting. It shows us the overall distribution of how long each review is. Maybe we want to break this down further and now is a longer review tending to be positive or negative in nature, right? So there's some different things we could do as it relates to the review length. The last thing we have down here is a word cloud. Now what this is trying to do is visualize how common certain words show up in the data here and it makes sense. Things like film, movie, and so forth are are common. I think it might be easier just to plot this as like a bar chart or something. People often criticize word clouds as being kind of hard to read and not really conveying that much actionable information. They look kind of cool, but really hard to make heads or tails of them sometimes. So it's interesting that in this case, Copilot gave us plots, right? Whereas in the last example we had to ask for those specifically. You want to make sure that you're using visualizations and tables and analyses together with Copilot and Python. So again, good to understand and have good questions in mind already for what might be important. So one thing that I'm going to do is let's specify something a little further. I'm going to ask Copilot to provide the most common 15 words for either sentiment, positive or negative. (keyboard clacking) Okay, now it looks like in this case we do get an error that Copilot is not able to fix itself. I am heading over to cell A40 and it looks like we have a timeout error. So what happened here is this Python code is running, the results are being executed on the cloud and being sent back to our workbook and it looks like there was just some kind of timeout. This is a larger data set, so we may need to just try again. I'm going to go ahead and just ask this again and let's see if we can get lucky. This is a bigger data set, so I'm not too surprised that we're going to get a timeout here. I was able to run this earlier, so let's see what happens this time. Okay, now it looks like we were able to get a result here. However, preview is not exactly in a very readable format right now. We could try to get a preview of it, but all we're seeing is this data frame value here. So what I'm going to try to do this in this case, is ask Copilot to visualize this. Let's see if we can get a nice plot of these results. (keyboard clacking) Okay, so it looks like this works. Let's zoom in here a bit and you will see the top 10, or I'm sorry, the top 15 most common positive words, right? Top 15 most common words in negative reviews, to be more specific. You can take a look at these, this does go to show how tricky it can be to analyze text and understand the meaning of text data as you're going to see here, things like good and great do show up in the positive reviews, however good actually shows up in the negative reviews as well. So we'll leave it at that and you can explore this further if you wanted to perhaps ask Copilot to build a predictive model asking can it predict whether a movie review is classified as positive or negative? You could try that, but as you're seeing here, you really need to be able to roll with the punches and ask different things of Copilot, whether you're getting a timeout, whether the output isn't quite in a format that's easy to understand, right? Having that inquisitive mindset and really knowing the analyst toolbox of different ways to format the data, different ways to interpret the data, different diagnostics that you might want to run before you take an analysis's gospel is going to be really important as you work with Copilot and Python, 'cause there's so many directions that this tool can take. So you just want to make sure that you can get exactly what you want via these prompts.
#### Challenge: Copilot for data analysis (1m 11s video)
(upbeat music) - [Narrator] This chapter focused on maximizing the use of Copilot for analyzing your data with visualizations, conditional formatting, and more. For this challenge I've provided you with a new data set, your objective is to analyze it with Copilot's assistance. The exercise file for this challenge is named 03_04_ch03_challenge. Begin by examining the average review column. Determine how closely each category approaches a five star rating by applying a data bar conditional format. Next, you'll analyze the potential correlation between average review and return percentage. Instruct Copilot to create a visualization for this comparison and then assess the outcome. Moving on to revenue analysis, I'd like you to chart revenue over time to identify any patterns or seasonal trends. Ask Copilot to generate this visual. Finally, let's delve into sales performance by category. See if you can find the leading product category by revenue. Work through these tasks and feel free to explore any other questions that pique your interest. I'll meet you over in the next video.
#### Solution: Copilot for data analysis (3m 24s video)
(upbeat music) - [Instructor] Now it's time to harness Copilot for visualizing, analyzing, and enhancing our data insights. You can find the exercise file for the solution at 03_05_ch03_solution. First, I will apply a data bar format to the average review column, which visually represents review scores. The longer the bar, the higher their review. (clicking) This formatting quickly highlights products and months with subpar reviews, allowing us to search for underlying issues. Poor product reviews can negatively impact a business in several ways, including an increased likelihood of returns. By requesting Copilot to map out the relationship between average review on returns percentage, we obtain a scatterplot that clearly shows the inverse relationship. Higher reviews correlate with fewer returns. (no audio) We can add this to the sheet or move on with the next prompt. Let's go ahead and look at revenue over time. (clicking) For this one, a line chart is a great visualization, as it illustrates an overall trend interspersed with periods of notable fluctuations. I will add this one to a new sheet, and you can examine the results as needed. (clicking) Now it looks like this chart isn't visualizing. (clicking) If you do have a case where the chart is not showing on your worksheet completely from Copilot, try to click the chart elements icon and add something like a grid line or a legend. That seemed for me to add the entire chart to my worksheet and make it visible. Now let's go ahead and return back to the source table. I am now going to identify the bestselling category, (no audio) and it looks like in this case, Copilot gave us the answer in a couple of ways. Here I have the written out response. I can also insert this PivotTable into a new worksheet, and it looks like for some reason, that didn't register, we can't add it. So we have the number here. Looks like we could try again later and get the PivotTable result as needed. So again, be flexible. Make sure that you can combine your own Excel skills with Copilot's to get the answers needed. Our exploration here reveals that even a straightforward data set like this one can uncover significant patterns and relationships with Copilot, proving to be immensely valuable in guiding business decisions. Are there any other insights that came up for you in your exploration? What stood out to you? Excel is an accessible tool for such analysis, and Copilot amplifies this utility, making it even more powerful for users at any skill level to extract meaningful information from the data.

## Copilot in PowerPoint: From Prompt to Presentation
### Introduction
#### Copilot in PowerPoint (54s video)
- [Julie] Have you ever stared at a blank slide wondering where to begin or how you'll ever get this presentation finished? Copilot and PowerPoint can help you with that. Copilot is a powerful AI assistant that can help take your ideas from a prompt to a presentation. In this course, I'll demonstrate how to use Copilot to create a new presentation about a particular topic, and I'll show you how to point Copilot to an existing document and return the information in that document. as a draft presentation. I'll walk you through various ways to understand and fine tune your presentations, and I'll show you how to ask Copilot for help, whether you have a general presentation question or if you need help with a PowerPoint feature. And a special note to presentation professionals, Copilot can't replace you and your talents. However, when used as an assisted PowerPoint Copilot might just save you time. I'm Julie Terberg. I invite you to join me on my LinkedIn learning course, "Copilot in PowerPoint: From Prompt to Presentation."
#### What you should know (1m 7s video)
- [Instructor] To get the most out of this course, there are a few things you should know. I'm working in PowerPoint, Microsoft 365 for Enterprise with an M365 Copilot subscription, and I'm on a Windows system. At the time of this recording. M365 Copilot is only available for Enterprise customers who have licensed Copilot for use. Microsoft officials say they plan to make M365 Copilot available to Business Standard and Premium subscribers, but no date has been provided yet. Your version of PowerPoint might look slightly different. Your version of Copilot might look slightly different too. Like other features in Microsoft 365 and PowerPoint, there will be updates and improvements to Copilot features and to the Copilot pane. The basic elements should remain the same. This course is designed for PowerPoint beginners, but the lessons on Copilot can be helpful to Power users too. I'll be demonstrating the Copilot pane, some tools on the ribbon, and also sharing some keyboard shortcuts. You can follow along with the basic steps in each lesson using templates, presentations, and documents on your own system.
### 1. Getting to Know Copilot in PowerPoint
#### Overview of Copilot features (4m 18s video)
- [Instructor] When you open a file or start a new presentation in a PowerPoint, the Copilot button will appear on the top right side of the home ribbon. I've started a new blank file and I'll select the Copilot button to launch the pane. The Copilot pane includes two main sections. The top portion includes a brief statement followed by a set of suggestions you can try, and the bottom of the task pane is the prompt window. This is where you send instructions to Copilot. The suggestions at the top of the task pane and the bottom in the prompt area will change depending on if you're working on a new file or a saved presentation. I've started a new blank file, so the top of the pane suggests three things to try. Create a presentation, create a presentation from file or add a slide about. At the bottom, the prompt window reads, "Ask a question or make a request." You can type directly into this prompt window. Ask Copilot a question or make a request, these are called prompts. Type a new prompt yourself or use one of the examples in the Copilot pane as a start and fill in the rest. Notice the small numbers at the bottom of the prompt window. This is the character count. You can type in a maximum of 2000 characters, including spaces. There are also three icons in the prompt window. The first is View Prompt, then Microphone, followed by the Send arrow. Choose the Microphone to dictate directly into the prompt window and select the Send arrow each time you finish typing a prompt and you're ready to hand it off to Copilot. The Enter key works the same way. After you've typed a prompt, press Enter on your keyboard to send it to Copilot. Selective icon to View Prompts, reveals more suggestions. Create, Edit, Ask, and View more prompts. When you choose one of these options, you'll see examples for how that type of prompt can help you create or edit content. I'll choose the Create prompt. And you'll see different examples like create a presentation from file, create a presentation about with some sample topic and parentheses, and add a slide about with another example. When you select any prompted suggestion, the text is going to change in the prompt window to include that as starter text. I'll choose, create a presentation about, and you'll see the blinking cursor appears ready for me to describe what type of presentation I want copilot to create. Alternatively, you can type the full prompt yourself. Going back to View Prompts, if I choose Edit, you'll see an example that says, "Add an image of" with a sample topic in parentheses. And going back to View Prompts, if I choose Ask, you'll see examples for how copilot can help including specific examples from your presentation. Now, the Copilot pane changes a little when you open an existing presentation. I'll open this Globe Bank presentation. And first off, we see a notification that says, "Get a summary from Copilot." I'll choose Not now, and open up the Copilot pane from the home ribbon. Because we're working with an existing presentation rather than an empty file, the suggestions for prompts change to; create a presentation from file, summarize this presentation and organize this presentation. Notice that Copilot has surfaced a couple of questions above the prompt window. These questions are directly related to the current presentation. If you select one of these questions, Copilot will review the presentation content and reply directly in the pane. With the same presentation open again, I'll choose the View Prompts icon. And now each prompt category is going to show additional examples that pertain to an existing presentation versus creating a new one. And there's a new topic, Understand. I'll select Understand, and you see examples for prompts to help you comprehend or gain insights about the presentation content. The examples include prompt ideas like summarize, show action items or key slides.
#### Discovering prompt ideas in Copilot Lab (2m 13s video)
- [Instructor] At the bottom of the Copilot pane, select the view prompt icon, and you'll see an option to view more prompts. Choose this to open up the Copilot Lab window. Here, you'll see more suggestions for how you can prompt Copilot to help you with your presentation. Some of these prompts are similar to those in the Copilot pane. Others offer new ideas such as get a head start and generate ideas. At the top of the window, there's an option for saved prompts. You can bookmark any one of the prompts to save it, similar to bookmarks or favorites in a browser. There's an option for categories. You can choose from, create, ask, edit, and understand to serve as prompts for that type of task. I'll select create and that reveals prompt ideas for creating new slides or presentations. Under generate ideas, there's a full prompt example, create a presentation about how to with a sample in parentheses. When I select any one of these prompt ideas from the Copilot Lab window, it will populate the starter text in the prompt window. The blinking cursor signifies that you'll have to complete the prompt with your own specific request. At the bottom of the Copilot Lab window is a link to go to Copilot Lab. Pressing this button launches the Copilot Lab website. Now on the website, at the top are featured prompts. And scrolling down further on the page is a section called "More prompts to try." There are two menus here, app and categories. I'll open app and choose PowerPoint. And now the list of prompts are directly relevant to creating or editing a presentation. Under categories, there are five topics. I'll select create, which will narrow the prompt suggestions specific to that task, creating new slides or presentations. The Copilot Lab website also includes tips for writing better prompts and there's an FAQ section about Copilot prompts. I imagine this site will grow with new prompt ideas as Copilot features evolve and expand. It's worth checking on occasion to see what's been added.

### 2. Starting a Presentation from Scratch
#### Create a new presentation starting from a blank file (2m 7s video)
- [Instructor] When creating a new presentation with Copilot, you can begin with a blank file or one of the Microsoft templates. And as a big time saver, you can use Copilot to generate a new presentation from your company template or even an existing presentation. I'll start with a new blank file and create a presentation from a prompt, select Copilot from the Home ribbon to open up the Copilot pane. From the top of the pane, I'll choose Create a Presentation. And now at the bottom in the Prompt window, I'll add a description of the presentation I want Copilot to create. I'll use a generic topic for this example, and I'll use the microphone to dictate the text into the prompt. Choose the microphone icon, about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. Press the microphone again when you're done talking, and now you can press Enter on the keyboard to send this instruction to Copilot or use the Send arrow. You'll see a few progress comments while Copilot is working, and at any point, you can choose Stop Generating if you want to cancel the process. Done, Copilot has drafted five slides complete with photos and texts describing the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. Because I started with a blank, Copilot chose one of the Microsoft templates to complete the draft slides. The slides include titles, supporting text, and a picture relating to the content. Looking at the speaker notes, open up the Notes pane here and drag this bar up so that you can see them better, Copilot included more text, suggestions for what to say when presenting the slides. And along with the finished slides and notes, Copilot returns a comment that says here's a draft of your deck. If you'd like, I can help you rewrite slides or you can use Designer to adjust layouts. Smaller text below that says, AI-generated content may be incorrect. This is a reminder, you'll have to fact check the content on the draft slides for accuracy.
#### Create a new presentation starting from a template (3m 26s video)
- [Instructor] Let's ask Copilot to create a presentation from a template. I'll use a Microsoft Office theme for this example. Select File, New, and choose one of the Office themes. You can scroll through the options on the new screen, or type a topic in the search bar. I've recently opened Color Swatch, so it shows up here at the top. I'll choose Color Swatch, and then press Create to open the file in PowerPoint. The file opens to a title slide with a colorful picture on it, and some placeholder text. And there's a second slide with icons and more placeholder text. Now I'll open Copilot from the Home ribbon. This will open up the Copilot pane. From the top of the pane, I'll choose Create a presentation. And then at the bottom in the prompt window, I'll add a description of the presentation I want Copilot to create. I'll use the microphone to dictate my text into the prompt window. Press Microphone. About best practices for participating in remote meetings. Press the icon again when you're finished talking. Now, to send the instructions to Copilot, I can press Enter on my keyboard, or select the Send Arrow. A few comments while Copilot is working, and you can choose Stop Generating if you change your mind. Copilot has returned a note that says "Creating a new presentation "will replace your existing slides, "so you may want to save a copy first." That's because the sample slides in this theme have sample content on them. It's not a blank file. I will choose Create a new draft, and remember to save my file with a new name after. Select Create new draft. And done. Copilot has drafted six slides about remote meetings, and it's completed in the Color Swatch template. Each slide contains a title, supporting text, and a picture that relates to the content on the slide. Copilot also included speaker notes, I'll expand the speaker notes here so that you can see them. Full talking points on each subject. Again, in the Copilot pane, Copilot offers to help you rewrite slides, or you can use Designer to adjust layouts. The disclaimer at the bottom reminds us to fact check Copilot's draft texts for accuracy. Let's look at other designs that Designer suggests for this slide about testing your technology. With the slide open in the editing window, I can launch Designer from the Home ribbon, or I can select Designer highlighted here in the Copilot pane. When I choose any one of the ideas in the Designer pane, the current slide updates to that design, I can continue selecting designs until I find one that I like. If you change your mind, simply Undo. You can press the Control and Z keys on your keyboard, or select the Undo icon from the Quick Access toolbar. Remember, save your file with a new name.
#### Create a new presentation starting from an existing file (2m 50s video)
- [Instructor] There may be some cases where you don't have a template or can't locate the template, but you do have an existing presentation, one that you want Copilot to use as a template for a new presentation. I've opened a Globe Bank file in PowerPoint. The file has 14 slides in it. But when I open the Layouts gallery from the Home Ribbon, you can see that it's built with the Globe Bank template. There are 30 different layouts built into this template. I'll leave the slides as they are for now and launch Copilot from the Home Ribbon. Because this presentation has slides in it, the copilot pane suggestions reflect that, and include things like Summarize This Presentation and Organize This Presentation. I don't want to try either of those. I want to create a new presentation that uses this look, this underlying template. Let's look at the View Prompts in the Prompt window to see the examples under Create. I'll choose this second example, the suggestion Create a Presentation About. And now I need to describe the presentation in the prompt window. I'll use the microphone to dictate. Press the microphone icon. Various ways employees can volunteer their time. And press the microphone again when you're finished talking. Now, I'll press Enter on the keyboard, or you can use the Send arrow to send the instructions to Copilot. A few process comments while Copilot is working. Copilot returns the message that says, "Creating a new presentation will replace your existing slides, so you may want to save a copy first." This is because our file has existing slides. It's saving you from overriding your work. I will choose Create a New Draft, and then save the results later with a new file name. Choose Create New Draft. Copilot says it's finishing up. You can press Stop Generating if you want to cancel the process at any time. And done, six slides on our volunteering topic. The slides use the Globe Bank template, and Copilot has drafted slides using a few different slide layouts. I'll stretch this bar up so you can see Copilot has returned speaker notes supporting the content on each slide. And there's a note in the Copilot pane offering to help you rewrite slides, or you can use Designer to adjust layouts. The disclaimer at the bottom, this is a reminder, fact check Copilot's draft decks for accuracy. And remember, save your presentation with a new file name.
#### Chapter Quiz (3 questions)
### 3. Starting a Presentation from a Document
#### Create a new presentation from a document (4m 15s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot can create a presentation from a document. This can be a huge time saver and it's a perfect task for Copilot. To start with, I'd like the draft presentation to be in the Globe Bank brand, so I've opened their template. This template has a set of sample slides included. I can leave these slides for now because will replace them with all new draft slides. I'll save the file later with a new name. I'll launch Copilot from the top right of the home ribbon. This will open up the Copilot pane, and from the top of the pane, I'll choose the second suggestion. Create presentation from file. At the bottom, Copilot automatically surfaces some suggested files from my recently opened documents. Now, in order for Copilot to create a presentation from a file, that file must be a Word document and it has to be located on your OneDrive or SharePoint. I'll press the Alt and Tab keys on my keyboard to switch to my open OneDrive site. For the presentation content, I'll use this word doc called About Globe Bank International. It consists of about four pages of text with headings, supporting paragraphs, and bulleted items. I can choose the three dots next to the file name and copy link. You can also right-click on the file name and do the same thing. Great. It says "link copied." I can close this dialogue and use the Alt + Tab keys on my keyboard to switch back to PowerPoint. Now, I'll put my cursor in the prompt window and then press the Control and V keys on my keyboard. That will paste the link that I just copied from OneDrive. Now I need to press Enter on the keyboard or choose the send arrow to send the prompt to Copilot. A few process comments and Copilot returns a note, "Creating a new presentation will replace your existing slides, so you may want to save a copy first." We can either save a new copy now or create a new draft and save it later. I'll choose Create new draft. Copilot says that it's finding my file and drafting the presentation. While it's working, Copilot returned an outline of the presentation that it's generating. This is a list of topics from that source document, along with the reminder that AI generated content may be incorrect. It's generating the slides and adding speaker notes. Done. Copilot returned a note. It's drafted nine slides and made some changes based on the doc. It included speaker notes containing additional details, added images to make the deck more engaging, and applied layouts to organize slides. Also, you can use Designer for adjusting layouts, and then our AI generated content may be incorrect. Reminder at the bottom to fact check. Let's look at the few slides that were drafted by Copilot. Now, this title slide looks blank. I can apply another layout from this template or use Designer for suggestions. The same is true for any of the slides drafted by Copilot. There's an Agenda, About Globe Bank, Our Worldwide Presence, Global Vision, and so on. Now, let's see what Copilot suggests for this slide. I'll choose Designer from this note on the Copilot pane and it's generating design ideas. And now I can choose any one of these new slide thumbnails, and the slide will change in the editing view. At any point, you can select undo on the Quick Access Toolbar or press Control + Z on the keyboard to undo. Now the last step here, I need to save this draft presentation. Select the save icon from the Quick Access Toolbar, or you can choose File, Save, or press Control and S keys on your keyboard. Don't forget to give your file a descriptive name.
#### Chapter Quiz (1 question)
### 4. Adding New Slides with Copilot
#### Add a slide about a specific subject (2m 6s video)
- [Instructor] You can prompt Copilot to add new slides to an existing presentation. Maybe you just learned of an additional topic for a meeting or you'd like an agenda slide. Ask Copilot to add a slide and describe what you need in the prompt text. I've opened this draft presentation that Copilot generated on the topic "Ways Employees Can Volunteer Their Time." Let's add a new slide to this deck. I'd like the new slide to be at the end, so I'll select the last slide. Copilot will add the new slide after this one, and then I'll launch Copilot from the home ribbon. From the top of the Copilot pane, I'll choose "Add a slide about". Now this prompt suggestion can also be found when you choose "View prompts" and then "Create". It's the third option here. Or you can simply type this into the prompt area, "Add a slide about". Now I need to describe the type of slide that I want Copilot to create. I'll use the microphone to dictate. Select the microphone icon. The benefits of volunteering. And press the microphone when I'm done talking. Now to send the instructions to Copilot, I can use the enter key on my keyboard or press the send arrow, and that sends the prompt off. Copilot returns a few process comments. You can always cancel by choosing "Stop generating". And done. Copilot has returned a slide about the benefits of volunteering with a few statements and a picture. In the pane, Copilot says, "Here you go. If you'd like, Designer also has some other layout options to consider." Along with the small text, reminding us to double check all draft content for accuracy. Now, a tip here, you can ask Copilot for more than one slide in a single prompt. You can try something like, "add three slides about", and fill in the specific information that you want Copilot to return on those new slides.
#### Add an agenda slide (1m 14s video)
- [Instructor] Using the Employee Volunteering presentation, let's add an agenda slide right after the title slide. I'll launch Copilot from the Home ribbon. Now, Copilot Lab features more prompt ideas than shown in the Copilot pane. From the Prompt window I'll choose the View Prompt icon and then select View more prompts to open the Copilot Lab. One of these prompts is Add an agenda slide. When you choose a prompt suggestion from Copilot Lab it populates the Prompt window with that text. Alternatively, you can simply type it in yourself, Add an agenda slide. Now, I need to send the instructions to Copilot by choosing the Enter key on my keyboard or selecting the Send arrow. And you can cancel at any time by choosing Stop generating. And done, Copilot has returned a draft agenda slide listing each of the main topics in the presentation. In the pane Copilot writes, "Here you go. If you'd like, Designer has some other options for you to consider," with the small disclaimer at the bottom reminding you to thoroughly review, proof, and check all of the draft content.

### 5. Refining a Presentation with Copilot
#### Organize a presentation (1m 39s video)
- [Instructor] There are various ways to use Copilot when refining a presentation. Copilot can organize your presentation, grouping slides into sections, and it can be helpful when editing slide content whether the slides were generated from a prompt or not. First, let's organize a presentation into sections. I've opened a Globe Bank presentation that copilot created from a file. I'll launch copilot from the Home Ribbon and from the Copilot pane, I'll choose organize this presentation. While it's working, you'll see a few process comments and you can cancel at any time by choosing stop generating. Copilot's putting it all together, looking things over and done. Copilot has modified the presentation and added a note in the Copilot pane. Here's a suggestion for how to structure your deck. It's grouped the slides into sections and it's added a few new slides. I'll open up the thumbnails pane a little bit wider by dragging this bar so you can see Copilot did include a few sections and grouped our slides into those sections. It's also added a new slide introducing each section, services, customers, about Globe Bank International and Agenda. Now, at any point, if you don't like any of these pictures, you can use Copilot to replace that picture. I'll show you how later in this chapter.
#### Rewrite slide text (2m 12s video)
- [Instructor] Editing text is a time-consuming task. This is a good use for Copilot. When you're refining slides in a presentation, you can prompt Copilot to do the editing for you. Let's try it out with this volunteering draft that I have open. I think the text on this slide is a bit wordy, so let's ask Copilot to make some edits. I'll open Copilot from the Home ribbon, and at the bottom of the pane in the prompt window, I need to tell Copilot how I want it to edit this slide. I'll use the microphone to dictate the prompt, edit the text to short phrases. When I'm done, select the microphone to stop dictation, and now I can press Enter on the keyboard or select the Send arrow to send the prompt to Copilot. While it's working, you'll see some process comments. Of course, you can always cancel by choosing Stop generating. All set. Copilot has edited the text, and now we have shorter phrases for each statement. This is just one way to prompt Copilot to edit text. Let's try another. On this slide, I'll type a new prompt in the prompt window using the microphone to dictate. Rewrite text to be more conversational. Select the microphone when I'm done. Press Enter on the keyboard, or choose the arrow to send the prompt to Copilot. We see process comments, and done. It has rewritten the slide. It is a paragraph of text instead of separate bullet points. The headline is more conversational. Now you can try other prompts, like edit this text into two brief statements or rewrite text to be more professional. Experiment with slight wording changes in your prompts to get different results from Copilot. And if you don't like the results, you can always undo by pressing the Undo button on your Quick Access Toolbar, or press the Control + Z keys on your keyboard to go back to the original slide.
#### Change text formatting (2m 42s video)
- [Instructor] You can ask copilot to change the text formatting on your slides. Things like make text bold or italic or recolor titles for instance. This presentation drafted by copilot uses a bold style for titles. Let's make a global style change. First, open copilot from the top right of the home ribbon. At the bottom of the copilot pane in the prompt area, I'll use my microphone to dictate a new prompt. Select the microphone. Change all titles to non bold. Press the microphone when I'm done, and then I need to send the instructions to copilot using the enter key on my keyboard or the send arrow. A few process comments and finished. Let's look at a few of these slides so you can see the titles are now all non bold. Let's try another simple formatting change. This time, I just want to make the change to this slide. I'll dictate into the prompt area again, select the microphone icon, change the title color to orange. Press the microphone when you're done dictating, and then send the prompt to co-pilot using the enter key on your keyboard or the send arrow. And co-pilot's working and finished. Our title is now orange on this slide, but it's remained blue on the other content slide. Next I'll ask copilot to change the title font on all slides. In the prompt area at the bottom of the copilot pane, I'll type change all title font to Sagona. Now I'll press the enter key on my keyboard, or you can use the arrow key to send the prompt to copilot. And completed. Each title is now in the Sagona font. Remember, if you don't like the results that copilot returns, you can always undo. Select the undo button from the quick access toolbar, or press the control and Z keys on your keyboard to undo. Also, when you're changing colors or fonts, realize that copilot is only changing these on the slide level. The underlying slide master and layout retains its original formatting. If you find a prompt isn't working, try rewarding it. Sometimes copilot is looking for a specific name that PowerPoint uses for a feature or a slide element.
#### Replace a picture (1m 39s video)
- [Narrator] When you're reviewing a presentation drafted by Copilot, you might find a picture doesn't quite fit with the slide, text, or topic. You can ask Copilot to replace that picture with something else. Let's try it in this volunteering presentation. First, I'll open Copilot from the top right of the home ribbon and then I'll switch to the second slide. I don't think this picture quite suits the slide topic, so I'll ask Copilot to change it. In the prompt area at the bottom of the Copilot pane, I'll use the microphone to dictate the new prompt. Select the microphone icon, "Replace picture with people volunteering". Press the microphone icon when I'm done. And now to send the prompt to Copilot, press Enter on my keyboard or press the Send icon. A few process comments while Copilot is working. And finished. That's much better. And Copilot has returned this picture from Microsoft Stock Images. You can use these in your presentations. Copilot has also reformatted the slide using a different slide layout. The same layout is used by a few other slides in this deck. Along with the new slide, Copilot returned a note, "Okay, here you go. This picture has been replaced with people volunteering at a charity event." At any point, you can replace a picture yourself. You can insert your own pictures or a new one from the Microsoft Stock Image Library for instance, and notice the disclaimer is there too, reminding you to check everything for accuracy.
#### Chapter Quiz (4 questions)
### 6. Understanding a Presentation with Copilot
#### Summarize a presentation (1m 32s video)
- [Instructor] Sometimes you receive a large presentation and need to quickly retrieve some facts or information from the slides. Copilot can save you time with that. You can use it to summarize a deck, show action items, or perhaps call out key slides for review. I've opened a Globe Bank presentation that Copilot drafted from a file. I'll open Copilot from the top right of the home ribbon, and at the top of the Copilot pane, I'll choose summarize this presentation. You'll see some process comments while Copilot is working, and it's quickly returned a summary of the deck with four main ideas. I'll scroll back up so you can see them. Next to each main idea are some small numbers. These are references to the slides where Copilot pulled the information from. Scrolling down, you see there's a copy button. You can copy this summary, paste it into a document, or maybe on a new slide. Below that is a disclaimer reminding us to fact check Copilot's work for accuracy, and further down is seven references. I'll expand this and you'll see that Copilot has included the reference slides that it's used for the summary text. I can expand any one of these. When I select the slide title, it will automatically switch to that slide in editing view. The note has been expanded to show you the text that Copilot referenced for the summary.
#### Retrieve information from a presentation (3m 30s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot can help you understand and retrieve information from a presentation. You might want to know which slides have key ideas, or if there are dates, tasks, or a call to action. I've opened a Globe Bank presentation that Copilot created from a file, and now I'll open Copilot from the top right of the Home ribbon. Notice on the top of the Copilot pane, because our presentation has content, Copilot is suggesting a few things to try, like Summarize this Presentation or Organize this Presentation. Notice on the pane there are two questions above the prompt area. You might have seen these during other Copilot requests. Copilot has scanned the presentation and returned two questions that might help you understand a specific topic, or perhaps the overall subject. I'll select the bottom one: "What are some of the customers "of Globe Bank International?" Copilot returns a detailed answer, followed by a Copy button. You can copy this text and use it elsewhere. Notice the disclaimer text reminding you to fact-check the content for accuracy. Now, let's look at another way that Copilot can help you understand a presentation. I'll choose the View Prompt icon from the prompt area, and you'll see four different prompt categories. I'll select Understand. Now we see a few examples of ways that Copilot can help you understand the presentation, like summarize, or are there any dates or deadlines, show action items or showcase slides in this deck. I'll select the last one. We see some process comments while Copilot is working. And it returns a note. Here are some key slides with three slide titles and their slide numbers listed below. There's also a Copy button. You can copy these results and paste them onto a slide, or perhaps in an email to share with someone else. This is followed by the note about AI-generated content. Let's try another example. Press the View Prompt icon, and from there I'll select Understand. This time, from the examples list, I'll choose Show Action Items. Copilot returns a note that says, "No explicit action items were identified, "but here are some recommended next steps." Each bulleted statement is followed by a reference number. When I hover on the number, Copilot shows me the text it referenced from that slide. There's also a Copy button for you to copy and paste this information for use elsewhere. The note about AI-generated content, followed by six references. When I expand the arrow, I get an individual link to each referenced slide. I'll select the arrow next to the first reference. Copilot shows us the text that it referenced from slide one. When I select a slide title from the references list, it switches to that slide in the editing window. Try other prompts in Copilot to help you find the exact information you need from a presentation. Experiment with your prompts and see how Copilot can help you understand and retrieve content from a presentation.

### 7. Asking Copilot for Help
#### Ways that Copilot can help (53s video)
- [Narrator] Copilot can create and edit slides, and help you understand, organize, and summarize presentations. It can also help by answering specific questions about your presentation content, or it can answer a question you might have about presentations in general. You can also ask Copilot for help with a task in PowerPoint. I've opened a Globe Bank presentation. Now I'll launch Copilot from the home ribbon. At the bottom of the pane, I'll choose the view prompt icon, and then select Ask. This window includes a couple of examples. I'll select, How can Copilot help. And it returns a detailed note. I can enhance your productivity and help you create stunning presentations by, followed by four ways that Copilot can help. There's also a link to learn more about Copilot that takes you to a Microsoft support page.
#### Ask a general question (1m 1s video)
- [Instructor] I'd like to ask Copilot for help with a general presentation question. Open Copilot from the home ribbon. And at the bottom in the prompt area, I'll use the microphone to dictate my question. What are some tips for creating an effective presentation? Press the microphone icon when finished, and then select the send arrow to send the question to Copilot. A few process comments while it's working, and Copilot answers the question. It says, "this response isn't based on the presentation. "Here are some tips for creating an effective presentation." Followed with some guidance on that. There's a copy button and the disclaimer at the bottom. Below that, Copilot has included a couple of similar questions. You can select one of these and populate the prompt with that question. Send a Copilot and retrieve another answer.
#### Ask for help with a PowerPoint task (1m 20s video)
- [Instructor] Another way Copilot can help is when you'd like to know how to do something in PowerPoint. I'll switch to this slide and then open copilot from the home ribbon. And at the bottom in the prompt area, I'll use the microphone to dictate my question to PowerPoint. How do I change this slide layout? Press the microphone when finished and then send that question off to Copilot using the enter key on your keyboard or the send arrow. Few process comments while it's working. And Copilot has answered my question. You can find the change slide layout feature on the home tab of the ribbon, but I can't access it directly. Would you like me to show you where it is? I'll select the show me button, and a bold orange notification pops up with an arrow pointing to the layout tab. I'll select got it and open the layout tab now that I know where it is and I can choose a different layout from the gallery. These are just a couple of ways Copilot can help you in PowerPoint. Try asking Copilot for help the next time you need to find something in a deck or want to know something about presentations or if you'd like to know how to do something in PowerPoint.

### 8. Things to Keep in Mind When Using Copilot
#### Helpful things to know (2m 58s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot has some limitations that you should keep in mind. Copilot in PowerPoint doesn't save the context of your chat, so it won't be able to refer to things you said earlier. It can add only a limited variety of images. It can't yet add animations, transitions, videos, tables, SmartArt or other more complex object types. Copilot might not work well on a slide containing preexisting SmartArt tables or charts. And Copilot in PowerPoint doesn't currently support referencing organizational assets in Microsoft 365. There is a 2,000 character limit for prompt text. This includes characters and spaces in the prompt. When you've exceeded the threshold, Copilot returns a note that says, "I'm still learning. That request is too large. Would you mind simplifying your request to the one thing you want me to do?" I've found that Copilot returns better results when your prompts are limited to one task at a time. Be specific with your prompt. Want specific text on a slide? Put it in quote marks. Experiment with prompts to learn how Copilot responds. Vary the way you word your prompts and notice any subtle changes in the responses or on the draft slides. Refine your prompts until you find what works best for your specific needs. Copilot leverages GPT, a new AI system from OpenAI that creates text based on a prompt. As it is a new system, it may create things you didn't expect. Also, because new draft content is generated by AI that draws from the internet, it may contain inaccuracies or sensitive material. If you find unexpected or offensive content, send feedback to Microsoft. Just select the thumbs up or thumbs down button in the Copilot chat box. This feedback will be used to help Microsoft improve Copilot in PowerPoint. The interactions you have with Copilot in PowerPoint are not being used to train the large language models that Copilot uses. According to Microsoft, Microsoft 365 Copilot is built on Microsoft's comprehensive approach to security, compliance and privacy. Your data, including prompts, responses and the business data Copilot uses to formulate its response isn't used to train the foundational large language models that Copilot uses. Copilot is an assistant. It can get you started, but it's your responsibility to make sure the work was done correctly. When new content is drafted, Copilot includes a disclaimer, "AI-generated content may be incorrect." Be sure to review and verify the information that it generates. It's up to you to review all of the drafted content, including speaker notes, to make sure that your presentation is accurate.

## Copilot in Teams: AI-Powered Collaboration
### Introduction
#### Use the Copilot AI assistant in Teams (50s video)
- Copilot can help you catch up on work or find critical information just by asking. Copilot is Microsoft's artificial intelligence assistant and it enables several AI features in Microsoft Teams. Chat conversations and online meetings are vital communication tools in Teams, and with Copilot, you can ask for summaries for both, and even ask direct questions about ongoing conversations. If you're late to a meeting, Copilot can catch you up. And when sending messages, Copilot can offer rewrites with clearer, more consistent language to make communication more effective. I'm Nick Brazzi, and I'm going to show you how you can take advantage of the AI features that Copilot brings to Teams. And when you're finished, you'll be able to start using this powerful assistant to lighten your load and bring clarity to your workday.
#### Understand the subscription needed for Copilot (1m 21s video)
- [Instructor] The Copilot AI tools that we'll see in this course are only available to users with a Microsoft 365 account in their school, company, or similar organization. The version of Teams that uses Copilot is not available for home, personal, or family subscribers. You must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise organization. And additionally, the Copilot tools are not included with Microsoft 365 by default. You'll also need a license for the add-on subscription called Copilot for Microsoft 365. Organizations with a Microsoft 365 subscription have a Microsoft Administrator. That's usually somebody in the IT department who can purchase these licenses. If you do not have the Copilot license, then you should contact your administrator to ask if they can activate it. And for more information about the different Copilot products and the accounts or subscriptions that you need to use them, you can take a look at our short workshop on LinkedIn Learning called What Is Copilot. If you have a Microsoft 365 account with the Copilot add-on, then you should open Teams, and then just go into the account menu near the top right and confirm that you are signed into that account. If you have that set, then you're ready to use the Copilot AI tools in Microsoft Teams.
### 1. Using the Different Copilot Tools in Teams
#### Get summaries and answers about chat conversations (1m 52s video)
- [Instructor] In Microsoft Teams, the Copilot AI tools can summarize or answer questions about conversations in the chat section. So to start, I'll go to the sidebar on the left and click the Chat button to go to the Chat section. I have an ongoing conversation with Stewart, so I'll select that chat here. And of course, you could select a group chat if you wanted. When a chat is selected, you will find the Copilot button near the top right. Click that to open the Copilot panel. You may have used AI chat tools like this before. This one is connected to this chat conversation and can answer questions about it. Just type your question or request in the chat field at the bottom. And remember, you can use informal language when asking your questions. So I want a summary of this conversation, I can just type, "Catch me up," then hit the Return key, and it gives me the main points that were discussed recently without going back and reading all of the old messages. When you use this Copilot panel, not just here in Teams Anywhere, you might use Copilot chat, you'll see these little numbers. These are citations, and you can click on any of those to go to the original chat message that contain that information. So if you need a little more context, just use those citations. You can also ask direct questions about this conversation. In the chat field at the bottom, I'll ask were the catalog's mailed out? Then hit the Return key and it gives me the answer here based on information from this chat. Now finally, if you start using this and you're not sure what questions you can ask, you can click the button at the bottom that says More Prompts, and that will show some suggested questions you can ask based on the content of this conversation. Naturally, when you're finished, you can click the Copilot button up at the top to close that panel. I think you'll find that Copilot can be a great resource for finding information in ongoing chat conversations.
#### Use copilot to rewrite messages (2m 35s video)
- [Instructor] The Copilot AI is great at drafting text or rewriting texts that you've written to change the style or tone. When you have chat conversations or post messages in Team channels, Copilot can help you revise or rewrite your text to improve those messages. First, in the sidebar on the left, I'll go to the Team section, where you can post a new message or reply to an existing thread. I'll click the button to start a new post, and I want you to see below the text field, there is a Copilot button. Now, this is not able to write a draft of new text, at least not at the time of this recording, but if you start by writing your message first, you can click that button and ask Copilot to rewrite what you've written. So you can do that here in a Team channel or in a chat conversation. So in the sidebar on the left, I'll click the chat button to go to the chat section, and I'll select this conversation that I've been having with Stewart, and let's use that feature here. In the text field at the bottom, I'll write a new message, but before I send this message, I need to be careful with my tone. I'm talking to Stewart about a big problem, and I want to make sure it's communicated correctly. Below the text field, I can see that Copilot button, and this only works after you've typed a message. I'll click that and you've got the option to have Copilot rewrite the message or adjust the tone. So I'll change the tone. I'll choose to switch it to be more casual. It gives me a preview of the revised text. Once you have a version you like, you can just click replace to put that text into the message field. And when you're ready, go ahead and send the message. And did you know that you can edit messages even after you've sent them? Just point your mouse cursor at a message and these buttons will appear above it. This button that looks like a pencil is the edit button, so you can click that and then you can make changes, or in this edit view, you can click the Copilot button beneath the text field to get the AI assistant to rewrite it for you. So let's just change the tone again. I'll go into this menu and I'll switch it to be a professional tone. It shows the rewrite, and if you like it, you can click replace. Once you've finished editing your message, you can click the check mark to confirm. And now that message has been edited. Of course, there is a tag on this message that says it's been edited, so my teammates will know when a message was sent and later edited. So whether you're writing a new message or revising an existing message, Copilot can help you rewrite it or change the tone.
#### Use Copilot during a meeting (5m 28s video)
- Copilot can summarize, answer questions, and offer information about meetings while those meetings are in progress. But first, you should know that Copilot depends on a transcript of what is said during a meeting. So there are a few setup steps that you should be aware of. So, I'll go over to the Calendar section. I'll click the Calendar button in the sidebar on the left. And first I need to join a meeting. For now, I'll just click the button at the top that says, Meet now and Start a meeting. And I'll be alone in this meeting, but that will be just fine. We can still see the controls that we need. Now I see that there is a Copilot button up at the top. With the default configuration, Copilot will only work if there is an active transcript during the meeting. So if I click that Copilot button, it will ask me if I want to start the transcript. Anything that is said after the transcript has started, will be searchable using Copilot. Now, for now, I'm just going to dismiss this. I'm not going to start the transcription yet because there is another option. You can click the button with three dots in the toolbar at the top and go to where it says Record and transcribe. And you'll see that I have two options. One to start the meeting recording and one to start the transcription. But I want you to see if I just start the recording, it shows me a message telling me that recording and transcription have both started. So just keep an eye out as you start this. However you do it, you just need to make sure that the transcript is running and that it has been running for at least five minutes. And then you can use Copilot in a meeting. And if you do have the transcription visible, you can click this X to close it and you can continue, you don't have to leave it on the screen. Okay, so I'm going to leave this meeting. Now, in the rare case that you do want people to be able to use Copilot in a meeting, but you do not want to save a transcript of the meeting, you do have another option, but this option can only be set by the person who creates the meeting. To see this, I'm going to create a new meeting. I'll click the New meeting button up at the top. And if you're setting up a new meeting, you can put in the title, put in the people you want to invite and all of the other details, but the important thing that I want to see is listed under more options. So on the left, I'll click where it says More options. And I do think it's interesting to see that there's an option here where you can set it to have the recording start automatically when the meeting starts, so you don't have to remember to start the recording. That could be useful, but that's not what we're looking for here. I'll scroll down to this menu where it says Copilot. And in this menu you can set Copilot to work with a transcript or without a transcript. If you choose without transcription, Copilot would keep track of what people say in this meeting, but it would not save it in a transcription. If you make a change here, make sure you click the Save button here and then you can join that meeting and that's how it'll work. But for now, I'm not going to use this meeting, so I'll just close this and I'll close this as well. Okay, so that's what you need to get set up. To actually use Copilot, I'm going to join a meeting on my calendar. I have that meeting here, and in this case, some of my coworkers are already in that meeting and I've already missed the beginning, but I'm not worried because Copilot can catch me up. I'll click the Join button here, make sure that my camera and my audio are all set up. Then click Join now and I'll join that meeting. And hello everybody. Sorry to interrupt your meeting. I want to show how Copilot works here. Thanks for helping out. Okay, so now that I'm in this meeting, before I do anything, I want to confirm, Matt, when you started this meeting, you opened up Copilot and you started the transcription, correct? - I sure did. - Okay, great. So that has to be running for at least five minutes or this will not work, and I can actually see this panel here letting me know that that's running as well. So now I can close this and I can click the Copilot button up at the top. If you don't see that Copilot button, just click where it says More and you'll see it there. Or just make the window a little bit bigger like this. And then you should see that Copilot button there. So when I click that, I see the Copilot panel over here on the right. And then I can use this to ask questions about this meeting. And I think one of the most common questions you might ask if you're late to a meeting is, what did I miss? So I'll type that in, hit the Return key and give it a moment. And it gives me information about what they discussed when I was not here. Another way to get caught up is to ask it to make a table of information from the meeting. So I'll type make a table of milestones discussed. Now keep in mind, I don't know what they talked about before I was here. Maybe they didn't talk about milestones yet, but let's see what results we get. And it looks like they did talk about some milestones and it has enough information to put in a table for me here. That's great. I also like to ask direct questions sometimes. So in that text field, I'll ask which clients were discussed? Hit the Return key, and it shows me the specific clients they were talking about. So I can check this and get caught up without disrupting the meeting. Of course, there are other suggested prompts, so you can click the More prompts button down at the bottom and you can see some suggestions if you just want to get some ideas of other types of questions that you can ask. So that's how you can set up a meeting for Copilot and how to use Copilot while the meeting is in progress.
#### Get meeting summaries after meetings have ended (2m 49s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot in Microsoft Teams can help you get information about a meeting even after the meeting is over. I'll click the calendar button on the left to switch over to the calendar section. And on my calendar I can see a meeting that I had earlier today. As I said in another video, you can only use Copilot if the transcript was recorded during that meeting, or if the co-pilot without transcript option was enabled. And that applies to using co-pilot after the meeting is over, the transcript was recorded for this meeting and this meeting has ended. I can see information about this meeting by double clicking on it here in the calendar. Then up at the top, I can click this tab that says Recap. Now there's a button here where we can view the transcript, but above that there is the Copilot button. I'll click that and it opens the Copilot panel, and in this case, I did use Copilot during the meeting, and I asked some questions there. So I can see those questions are still in the conversation history, but I'll ask a new question here. I'll ask, which markets are we considering? And I'll hit the return key, and we see the answer based on what was said in the meeting. So you can ask direct questions or of course you could just ask for a summary. I'll type, summarize this meeting. And it gives me that summary here, but that's a little long. So I'll go back to the chat field and I'll ask it to gimme a shorter summary. And it gives me a summary that's not quite as long, or you can click where it says More prompts down at the bottom to get an idea of other options. And I can just click one of these suggested prompts to try it. I'll choose this option to suggest follow-up questions, and it works just as if I had typed in that prompt myself. It gives me the answer here. Now to finish, there's one last small detail, I'll click the close button up at the top. So we saw that you can get information about a meeting after it has ended. You can find the meeting here on your calendar and double click it as we saw, or you can go to the chat section in Teams. So I'll click the chat button and the sidebar on the left, and unless the meeting was connected to a specific Team channel, you'll see a summary of each meeting here as a chat thread after the meeting is over. Now these do not stay in the recent list forever, but shortly after the meeting is over, it may be an easier place to find it. So I can select that meeting summary here, there is a button for the transcript, and if there were any chat messages during the meeting, I would see those here as well. But of course, we want to click the recap tab at the top, then click the Copilot button and we can work with the same Copilot chat here. Just another way to find your post meeting recap. So if you miss a meeting and if the transcript was recorded during that meeting, then you can find all the information you need about the meeting using Copilot.
#### Use the Copilot chat assistant in Teams (4m 47s video)
- [Instructor] I'm looking at the website, Copilot.microsoft.com, where you can use the Copilot Chat Assistant. This is available to anybody. However, remember the subscription I mentioned at the beginning of this course. If you sign in here with an account that has the Copilot from Microsoft 365 license, then the Copilot Assistant can answer questions about your organization. And if you use Teams, then you can use this assistant to get information about your organization inside of Teams. So let's go over to Teams. I'll click the button with three dots in the sidebar on the left, and this is where you can find apps that run inside of Teams. You may see the Copilot app here, or you may need to use the search field at the top to search for it. Once you find it, just click on it to open it. And while you're using the Copilot Assistant, you'll see a button for it in the sidebar on the left. If you plan to use this on a regular basis, I recommend you right click on that button and choose Pin, and then that button will stay in the sidebar. So this is an AI Chat Assistant, but instead of answering questions using information from the internet, this is able to answer questions using information from your organization's Microsoft Graph. So it's able to find information about the people in your organization, documents stored on your company's OneDrive or SharePoint libraries, messages sent and meetings scheduled between your coworkers and more. So let's give it a try. I'm going to ask a question about a document that was shared with me in my company's OneDrive. So in the chat field, I'll write, "Which executives are mentioned in the," and then I want to refer to a specific document. And to do that, you can type the Slash key then start typing in the name of that document. And I see it found documents that I have stored or have been shared with me and my organization's OneDrive. This is the document I'm looking for. So I'll select that. That gives me my full question, so I'll hit the Return key and it answers the question based on the content of that document. Next, without any additional context, I can ask a follow-up question about the information that it just gave me. I'm going to ask a follow up question that will also need to pull information from my email. I'll type, "Have I ever sent an email to any of them?" Then hit the Return key and it found that information from my email. And remember, the Copilot Chat Assistant will show these little numbers, which are citations. These tell me where it found this information. So I could click on one of these citations and it would take me to Outlook and show me that actual email message. You can also ask questions about people in your organization. So I'll type in, "Which department does Stewart Mori work in?" Now, if you know the person's full name, of course you can feel free to write it just like that. But what if you know somebody's first name but you can't remember their last name? Well, let me delete a little bit here. And what you can do is type in the Slash key, then start typing in that person's first name, and it searches the company's directory. I see it found Stewart Mori, so I can click on him here. Then finish writing in the rest of the question. Then hit the Return key and it found the answer in my company's directory. And you can ask more complex questions, which can pull from other resources like your calendar. I'll ask, "When was my last meeting with Henry?" It gives me that information and of course there's a citation here. So I can click on this citation and it takes me to the information page for that meeting where I can see the transcript or attendance report or any other information that may have been saved from that meeting. I'll go back to the Copilot app. Now, if you ever need help thinking of questions that you can ask, you can click the More Prompts button just above the text field to see some suggestions. And from here, you could click where it says Go to Copilot lab, and this takes you to a webpage where you can see suggested prompts that you can use and several different Copilot tools. You may want to go to this App menu and set this to filter down to only show prompts for Microsoft 365 Chat. Of course, you could try some of these, or you could click this button to bookmark one so that you can use it in the Chat Assistant later. Of course, this version of the Copilot Assistant is able to use private information about you and your organization. That information is protected by the security features in Microsoft 365. To protect your organization's data, the Copilot Chat will only show information to you if you have security permission to view that information traditionally in other Microsoft 365 apps.
#### Extend skills with Copilot Studio (1m 56s video)
- [Instructor] In this video, I want to briefly mention Copilot Studio. This product is separate from the other tools we've seen in this course, and it requires its own separate subscription. Copilot Studio allows users to create their own custom AI chat tools. Custom Copilot chat bots can be published on a website or other platforms, or somebody can make a Copilot and publish it for their teammates to use inside of Microsoft Teams. If you want to learn how to use Copilot Studio, I recommend the course Copilot Studio First Look. But let's see how you might use a custom Copilot inside of Microsoft Teams. In the sidebar on the left, I'll click the Apps button. When somebody makes a custom Copilot, they can name it whatever they want. Somebody in my organization has made a custom Copilot, and they named it after our company, Globe Bank. So in the search field here, I'll search for Globe and scrolling through here, I can see it here in the search results. Now, there's much more information in that Copilot Studio course, but somebody in my organization made this chat assistant published it and made it available to their teammates in the same organization. I can find it here. I can click Add, and then choose Open, and I can use the chat bot here, which has been trained using our company's employee manual and related documentation, so it's able to answer policy and HR questions for employees at my company. So just to see how it works, I'll ask, what is our policy for employee absences, and hit the Return key, and it is able to answer that question. So even if you never use Copilot Studio yourself, at some point you may have the opportunity to use a Copilot chat bot inside of Teams that one of your teammates created. And of course, you can always learn how to use Copilot Studio if you want to make a Copilot of your own.


## Copilot in Outlook: Maximize Your Workday Efficiency
### Introduction
#### Use Copilot in Outlook (29s video)
- Copilot is your everyday AI companion in Microsoft Outlook. Whether you're composing a new email, replying to emails you received, or reviewing a lengthy thread that's been forwarded to you, Copilot can help you strengthen your writing, compose thoughtful replies, and analyze messages to give you the key takeaways. Hi, I'm LinkedIn Learning Senior Staff Instructor Garrick Chow. And in this course, we're going to look at some of the most useful ways you can have Copilot help enhance your emails and maximize your workday efficiency.
#### Understand Copilot subscriptions (2m 15s video)
- [Instructor] The name Copilot is used by Microsoft for several of their products and services. So before we jump into this course, I want to take a moment to clarify how the name applies to this specific course on using Copilot in Microsoft Outlook. So first we have a free version of Copilot. Anyone can use Copilot on the web by going to copilot.microsoft.com to ask questions, draft text, or generate images. There are some limitations to the free version of Copilot, such as the number of prompts you can use per day being capped, and the responses from Copilot potentially being a little slower. But again, anyone can use this web-based version of Copilot for free without an account. But the free version doesn't allow you to use Copilot and Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and so on. To use Copilot through those and other M365 apps, you have to have a paid subscription to Copilot, either through a personal or individual account or an account you have through work or school, also refer to as a business account. If you're subscribing as an individual, you'll be subscribing to a product called Copilot Pro. Copilot Pro is currently $20 a month, and you can see that one of the features of Copilot Pro is you can access Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps, which again is not available through the free web-based version of Copilot. Now, if your Microsoft account is through your work or school, that's considered a business account and the subscription for business accounts is called Microsoft 365 Copilot. In most cases, if you have your subscription through work or school, your network administrator or IT department will set up your Copilot subscription for you and you'll see Copilot when you open up your Microsoft 365 applications without having to do anything yourself. All right, so that's a quick overview of the different Copilot subscriptions. For this course, just bear in mind that you must have either a Copilot Pro or a Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription to see Copilot in Microsoft Outlook. If you'd like to learn more about what Copilot entails across Microsoft's products and services, including more about the web-based version of Copilot, be sure to check out my colleague Nick Brazzi's course, "What is Copilot: Get Started with Microsoft's Everyday AI Companion."
#### Check if you're using the new Outlook (2m 6s video)
- [Narrator] One other thing to be aware of if you want to be able to use all the features of Copilot in Outlook is that you have to use what's currently being referred to, at least as of this recording, as the new Outlook. Now, we're currently looking at the older or legacy version of Outlook in Windows. And while you can access some Copilot features here, when you say draft a new email, for example, here's the Copilot button or you can use it to draft a message or use the coaching feature. You'll only get the full experience if you're using the new Outlook. Now, one way to get the new Outlook is to come up to this upper right hand corner of the window and click this, "Try the new Outlook" switch here. This will either download and install the new Outlook for you, or if it's already on your computer, you can switch over to it from here. And now, we're looking at the new Outlook. Now alternately, if you don't have the new Outlook or any version of Outlook installed, you can open up the Microsoft store on your computer, do a search for Outlook, and that will bring up the latest version of Outlook, which you can then install from here. So, the new Outlook looks like this. You can see we have the Copilot menu in the ribbon, and the Copilot panel on the right is open. You can also access the Copilot chat experience by clicking the Copilot icon here in the left navigation area. I'll just go back to our inbox for now. And you can see the new Outlook switch is enabled. So again, this will give you the full Copilot experience in Outlook. Now the same thing goes if you're using Outlook on a Mac. First, make sure you're running the most current version of Outlook. If even after updating, you're still seeing this legacy interface, just come up to the switch at the top of the window and turn off legacy Outlook. And after a few moments, that switches us to the new Outlook for Mac. All right, so just make sure you're running the new Outlook on whichever operating system you're using. And let's jump into using Copilot.
### 1. Using Copilot in Outlook
#### Draft a new email message (4m 57s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot is a great resource to have at your fingertips when you need to compose a new email message but aren't quite sure how to get started. As long as you have a general idea of what your email is about, Copilot can help you compose it. In Outlook, start by clicking the New mail button. Then you can either click the Draft with Copilot link that appears in the body of the message area, or if you've already clicked in the body of the message and that link has disappeared, just go to the Copilot button in the ribbon and choose Draft. And that gives us the Draft with Copilot box, where we can tell Copilot what we want to compose. Now, when you write a command or request to an AI, what you're writing is called a prompt. We're not going to get too deeply into all the best practices of prompt writing in this course, but as a general rule, it's a good idea to be clear about what you want, to provide some context, and to be as specific as possible. Now, we can choose from some of the suggested prompts we see here, like give an update, announcement, create a newsletter, and so on, or we can write our own. Let's write our own for this example. So let's say I'm a manager and I need to let my team know that annual review time is approaching and they need to complete their self-reviews. So I'll click in here and write something like, "Act as a manager. "Let my team know that annual reviews "will once again be held in July this year, "and that they should have their self-reviews completed "and submitted by June 15th, "and that the tools to help them write their reviews "are available on our company SharePoint." So here I'm telling Copilot to take on the perspective of being a manager. I'm telling it what I want, to remind my team that annual reviews are approaching and that they should submit their self-reviews, and that tools to help them are available on our SharePoint. Let's click the Generate button and see what we get. And there it is. So for my prompt, we now have this email that reads, "I hope this message finds you well. "I wanted to inform you that our annual reviews "will once again be held in July this year. "As part of the process, "it is essential that each of you complete "and submit your self-reviews by June 15th. "To assist you in writing your reviews, "we have made a variety of tools and resources "available on our company SharePoint," and so on. So I think this message is actually pretty good. Now, it's a good idea to always consider Copilot-generated content as a first draft, and to always read every word it generates to make sure it applies to your situation and to customize it to suit your needs. Notice it even says here that "AI-generated content may be incorrect." So never take what it generates and send it out into the world without reviewing it and rewriting it yourself. Now, with that said, if the results weren't quite what you were looking for, or if you want to make some slight change, Copilot can continue to help you. Some things you can do after generating your content include coming down to the prompt window. And here we have a Keep It button. And you can click that if you're happy with the results. There's a Discard button to get rid of what it generated. And if you want to try again, you can click the Retry button. And it will go through the entire process again, giving you slightly different results from the same prompt. So now we have a new version of the email to check out. Now, the great thing about this is you can come down to the prompt window and use these arrows to switch back and forth between your results to decide which one you prefer to use as the starting point for your document. Now, if there are elements of both that you like, you might want to copy and paste them into a separate email and compile them together. But in this case, let's say I like version two but I still want to make some changes to it. Here under Modify Content, you can try the prompts to make it shorter or to make it longer, or you can click Change Tone, which gives you options to make the tone of the email more direct, casual, formal. Or you can have it compose the email in the form of a poem, which is more of a novelty to demonstrate Copilot's abilities, and probably not something you want to use in real work emails. Now, you can also type in your own custom instructions for what you'd like to change. So for example, I could type, "Make the tone a little more friendly and supportive, "and emphasize the importance of reaching out to me "if there are questions or issues." And we'll send that. And after a few seconds, we now have this third version, which says, "I hope this message finds you well. "I wanted to remind everyone that our annual reviews "will once again be held in July this year. "As part of the process, we kindly ask that you complete "and submit your self-reviews," and so on. Notice it ends now with, "Thank you for all your hard work and dedication. "I look forward to another great year ahead." So the tone is now definitely a little more friendly and supportive. Again, you can click through the different options, but once you have a draft you like, just click Keep It. And now I have a good starting point for my email to work with instead of having to draft a new email completely from scratch myself. You can see how Copilot can be a really big time-saver in Outlook. But again, be sure to take the time to review your draft and make any edits or additions you might need before sending it off.
#### Reply to email messages (2m 55s video)
- [Instructor] In addition to drafting an email from scratch, as we saw how to do in the previous video, Copilot can also help you draft replies to the emails you received. Copilot can look at the message you received and come up with a reply based on what you specify in your prompt. So I've selected an email I received where Pedro is asking if I have the most recent current technical specifications for a project we're working on. Notice here at the top of the message area Outlook is offering some quick ways to reply. It noticed that Pedro is asking me for something, so it offers to attach a file to the reply right away, or I can start my reply with, "Here's what I have" or "I will get them to you." Now, of course, we can also click the reply button to draft a reply. And notice down here at the bottom we have this draft with Copilot area. And these are a couple quick prompts we can click on. So we have "Sending them now," "Will check updates," "Aya has the info," or custom. So, for example, if I clicked sending them now, it will draft a reply for me. And just like that, we have this reply based on the general message of the reply I clicked. Notice it says here, "I'll go ahead and send them your way right now." And as we saw earlier, we can continue to refine the message by typing a prompt in the prompt area or by clicking the retry button to have it create another draft. For this example, let's click discard because maybe I want to include more specific information in my reply. So I can either click the custom reply option here at the bottom of the window, or if you no longer see that option, you can click the Copilot button in the ribbon and click draft. And Copilot is smart enough to know that I'm working in this particular message, so it opens up the prompt window here. And maybe here I'll say, "The current specs are still being reviewed by the tech team, and they've let me know that they'll update the Wiki by the end of day today." And we'll send that. And now it's drafted this reply for me. It says things like, "They've assured me that they will have the updates finalized and uploaded to the project Wiki by the end of the day. Thanks for your patience. Feel free to reach out," and so on. So it contains all the information that I wanted to share, but maybe Pedro and I are good friends. So I'm going to click the change tone menu, and I'm going to ask Copilot to compose my reply in a more casual tone. And there it is. And as we saw before, from here, you can further refine the reply by typing in another prompt or by clicking retry. I'm okay with this reply though, so I'll click keep it. And as always, be sure to review the draft and further customize it as necessary before sending it off. Maybe I'll just add at the end, "See you at the all-hands tomorrow." And once I'm happy with the reply, I can click send.
#### Summarize emails and email threads (2m 45s video)
- [Narrator] Copilot's ability to summarize emails can help you quickly get caught up on your messages. You can have Copilot summarize single emails to give you the important points or even long threads to help you understand what information or tasks you need to be aware of. For example, we're looking at an email here from Pedro to Kim, where he's forwarding Kim this long exchange between him and Aya in which they're discussing issues that have come up on the project they're all working on. And Pedro is asking Kim to provide her insight into these issues. And as you can see, there's a lot to read here. Now, a good way for Kim to jump in and get her bearings is to come up to the top of the window. And when you have an email selected, you'll see this "Summary by Copilot" option at the top of the email thread. I'll click that and Copilot will scan the entire discussion looking for and identifying key points and then create a summary. And you can see the summary now appears here at the top of the email detailing those key points. Now, depending on the nature of the email and the summary, this might be all you need to compose a thoughtful reply, but as always, you'll want to at least skim through the discussion and see if there's anything important that Copilot might have missed. Notice we also have this "Ask Copilot" button here, and that opens up the Copilot panel. And we can ask questions about this thread or dig deeper into the summary. Notice we have some prompt options here at the top, like show action items for me in this email, what are the key points, and so on. So for example, I'll click "Understand what are the key points in this email." And you can see that gives me a much more in-depth summary of the key points that Pedro and Aya have been discussing in this thread. Now we have some more suggested prompts here. Like I could ask, "What are the next steps for me?" Or "Can you provide more details on the technical challenges?" Or you can type in the prompt area at the bottom and ask Copilot your own question. Like, "Give me a summary of the proposed solutions." And again, we get a good overview from Copilot. And notice again, we can just keep asking follow up questions. It suggests "When is the preliminary report due?" and "What are the estimated costs?" So continuing to ask questions might actually allow you to gain insights that you might not necessarily get just from reading the actual messages. Copilot might bring up questions or angles on the issues that you hadn't thought of yourself. So by starting with the basic summary and then digging deeper with the Copilot panel, you'll have a pretty good idea of what the emails you've received are about and what actions or information the senders are looking for in your reply.
#### Receive email coaching (2m 27s video)
- [Instructor] Copilot in Outlook can provide helpful coaching with suggestions on ways to adjust the tone and clarity of your emails before you send them to make sure you're effectively conveying your message the way you intend. Here we have an email that Kim has composed to send to Pedro, essentially letting him know that she won't be able to join his team on a new project. Now, this message has been composed without Copilot so far, and it's the first draft Kim has written. You can have Copilot coach you in new emails or in replying to emails you received. Just either create a new message or click Reply on an existing message, and type your email, as we've done here. Then click the Copilot icon in the message ribbon and choose Coaching. Copilot will take a moment to read what you've written and analyze it. And now we have this box with categories for Tone, Reader Sentiment, and Clarity. So with Tone selected, Copilot is telling us that the overall tone of this email is friendly and professional, maintaining a positive relationship despite declining the request. It does note that it could be more supportive. Below this assessment, it offer suggestions like, instead of "I'm a little too busy," say "I currently have a full schedule" to sound more professional. Replace "I suggest you check in with Aya" with "Aya might be available to assist you" to make the suggestion sound more collaborative. And consider ending with, "Please let me know if there's any other way "I can support you" to offer further help. Clicking Reader Sentiment scrolls down to that area. And this basically addresses the way what you've written might make the recipient feel. In this case, it's telling us that the email is respectful and appreciative of the reader's request, but adding more appreciation could strengthen the positive sentiment. And again, it offers some suggestions. Then we have the Clarity area, and this has to do with how clearly we got the message across. In this case, Copal is telling us that the email clearly communicates the main points, but it could offer more details on alternatives and the nature of the projects. And once again, it offers some suggestions on how to improve the clarity. For example, if Copilot is telling you to offer more of an explanation for your actions but you don't feel that's necessary, you can just ignore that suggestion. We also have this Regenerate button here if you want to have Copilot scan your message again and give you slightly different coaching suggestions. We also have the option to Apply All Suggestions if you want it to rewrite the email for you, applying all of these suggestions it offers. And you can keep this coaching area open as you make your changes so you can reference these suggestions.
#### Chat with Copilot in Outlook (3m 31s video)
- [Instructor] So we've seen that in Outlook clicking the Copilot button in the ribbon opens up the Copilot panel, just like in the other M365 apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. And from here we can ask questions or perform tasks all while being able to use Outlook side by side with the chat. Not only can you ask questions about the emails you're viewing, but you can ask questions about your organization's data, you can pull information from the web, or even take action directly in Outlook. We have some prompt suggestions at the top of the panel to get you started. Now what you see here can vary, but we have things like stay on top by showing action items for me in this email, find something by finding relevant documents based on this email, and so on. And, of course, we know that down here at the bottom of the panel, you can type your own prompts. For example, instead of digging through my settings to set an out of office notification, I can just type "Set my out of office from tomorrow through Monday at 2pm." Copilot takes a moment and then it brings up the settings right here in the panel. It even generated an automatic reply people will receive if they send me an email during this time. Now, this is actually a perfect example of why we should always check what Copilot does. It got the dates right by setting the duration of my out of office, but in the automatic reply it's saying that I will be out of office until November 29th, even though we're still in February. So, again, this is a good example of always checking what AI writes for you. So I'll be sure to delete November 29th and put in March 3rd, so we can edit this automatic reply. We can change the duration manual if we need to. If we want to, we can click manage in settings to go directly to those settings in Outlook. I'll just close that for now. But if we're happy with the settings that Copilot has come up with here, I can click save. And we see the message here that that's been saved. And, again, if I go back into settings, we can see it correctly set my out of office time. So we've seen that you can use the chat panels to do things like ask questions about the emails you're reading and you can use it to draft messages or to get summaries or pull action items from emails. You can also use the Copilot panel to search for and schedule appointments. For example, I could say, "Find me a 45 minute block of time to meet with Aya next Tuesday 3/4." And Copilot checks my schedule for an open slot and suggests a time. It's suggesting 1:00 to 1:45 on Tuesday. Now I can click view to go to my calendar Outlook, and if I go to March, I can see I do in fact have that slot open from 1:00 to 1:45. So if I'm good with this time, I can click send to schedule the meeting and send the invite to Aya. And we get confirmation that Copilot has done that. So bear in mind that if you need to accomplish a task in Outlook, whether it's drafting or summarizing messages or scheduling meetings or changing some settings, remember that Copilot is there as your assistant to help you do or at least start the work for you.
