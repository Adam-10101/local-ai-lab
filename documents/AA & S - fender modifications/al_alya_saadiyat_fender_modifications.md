Andrea,

Emergency Procurement route has in principle been agreed.  Can you please draft a very short (email is enough) scope for Byrne Looby/Ayesa to provide a budget proposal so we can get the full go ahead ASAP.

Regards,
Gert

Hi Gert,

Both cone and panel need replacing unfortunately.

Importance: High

Andrea,

Thanks for this – just for clarity – only the plate needs to be replaced, or also the “cone” to attach it into the dolphin need to be replaced?

In either case, I assume that this replacement will need to be done from the marine side?

Regards,
Gert

Hi Gert,

The fender manufacturer shared a few additional details (informally):

-	Proposed fenders: the panel is 4m x 1.5m as per below figure.
 
We created a drawing to run a geometry check based on the vessel details (see attachment, we have also shown the existing fender). The proposed new fender size seems correct.
-	Budgetary estimate: 48,000 AED per fender.
-	Lead time: 80 days for fabrication (from order confirmation, following design).

Please let us know the way forward.

Regards

Andrea

Hi Gert,

We had an interaction with the fender manufacturer (http://www.amf-marine.com/).
The situation is as follows:
1)	We require a new, larger fender, including cone, panel, chains and anchors. This outcome comes from the (biased) fender manufacturer, but it is realistic by inspection. Also, no welding job will come with any liability coverage therefore we recommend avoiding it (if our engineering approval is required, that is).
2)	The fender horizontal load will slightly change (elevation, module, eccentricity, etc.). Consequently, a few design checks are required:
-	Dolphin stability/toe levels
-	Anchors/reinforcement/structural capacity
We do not foresee dramatic findings and expect to avoid major changes to the structure.
3)	The top of the new fenders will stick out about 1.5m above the current deck level (ADM Technical Superintendent in the email below mentioned 1.0m, we will probably end up in between). We need to talk to the operations team to see if this will cause major operational issues.
4)	AMF will send us a budgetary quote for the 8 no. new fenders on Monday. The cost of the marine contractor’s civil works will have to be added on top.
5)	With regards to the design check/update and the civil works, ideally we would use BL and Rover for ease, continuity and liability retention. But we had a bad experience with both so not sure. 
Proposed way forward:
-	We share the quote as soon as it comes in.
-	We run a technical meeting with AMF early next week.
-	We have a meeting with EU to explain what we found out?

Regards

Andrea

Hi Gert,

Can you please:

-	Send the fender photo (or presentation) you showed the other day
-	Confirm the issues applies in both Saadiyat and Al Alya, therefore all 8 no. fenders needs “fixing” (the commercial proposal are inconsistent from this point of view – as far as I can see at least).

Regards

Andrea

Dear CAPT ADEL,

Good day.

Please find attached three offers for the proposed modifications to the jetty fenders at Al-Aliah Island and Saadiyat Island terminals. The modifications aim to increase the height of the shore-side fenders by 1 meter at both locations, addressing the issue of ship fenders resting on the shore fenders due to changing tides. A total of 4 fenders at each location will require these adjustments.

The offers are as follows:

Titanium Marine: Modification for both Al-Aliah and Saadiyat terminals (Qty: 8 fenders) – AED 246,800.00.
MBK Marine Service LLC: Modification only for Saadiyat terminal (Qty: 4 fenders) – AED 206,380.00.
Safeen Dry Dock: Modification for both Al-Aliah and Saadiyat terminals (Qty: 8 fenders) – AED 212,000.00 (Cheapest option).

Additionally, we require approval from Mr. Wissem Kasdaghli for these modification works and confirmation from ADM-Infrastructure Department. Kindly advise if we can proceed with utilizing the infrastructure budget code for this modification. Your support and guidance on this matter are highly appreciated.

Awaiting your reply.
